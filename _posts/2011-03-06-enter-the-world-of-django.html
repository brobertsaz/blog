<p style="text-align:justify;">So I have continued down the road of Django.... I have tried out several different tutorials but at the end of the day I find myself stuck. Every tutorial that I have tried results in something going wrong. I do not think it is the fault of Django or the tutorials, I think it is just me :(</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But aside from the frustration, I continue on. This weekend met up with a Django expert in Phoenix and went over a couple of my tutorial and the issues I was having. After no time at all, I found that my issues or my problems were relatively very basic and all my fault.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are so many ways to reach the same endpoint in programming. Because of that there are so many paths that can be taken. Picture a trip from NY to LA; in the end you will get to LA but there are multiple paths top get there. That is why when you get stuck on something to do with programming, there isn't a simple question nor a simple answer for a solution. Therein lies the frustration.....</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Go to a forum or to an IRC channel and ask a question, and see what kind of response you will get.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this article all about? Simple, you will get pissed, annoyed and flat out frustrated trying to learn programming. All that being said; do not give up if this is what you want to do. Find a friend to help you, programmers are great at sharing their knowledge...all you have to do is ask. For me all I can say is thank you Aaron.</p>
