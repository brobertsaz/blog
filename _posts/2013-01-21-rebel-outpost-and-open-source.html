<p>So I blogged recently about giving back to the community.  Well we are.  When we are not working on Ruby on Rails client work, we are working on the <a href="http://railscrm.com">RailsCRM</a> which has been out for a bit in a more or less alpha state but is usable for anybody that wants it.</p>
<p>Next we have @the_tong_song who has been working on a sharable calendar built on Rails and @rickcarlino is going to be rolling out his goal setter application.</p>
<p>We will be adding these to our <a title="Ruby on Rails Web Development" href="http://rebel-outpost.com">Rebel Outpost</a> website very soon.</p>
<p>My future plans for <a title="Phoenix AZ Web Development" href="http://rebel-outpost.com">Rebel Outpost</a> is to dedicate 20% of our time to either open source or internal projects.  I hope that everybody makes that a goal for themselves as well.</p>
