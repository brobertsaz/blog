<p style="text-align:justify;">All I can say is that keeping up a blog is a lot more work than I ever thought it would be. With that being said, email me if you would like to add an article to my blog as a guest author.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have gotten quite a few requests for video tutorials and I am planning on creating some for geoprocessing.  I am thinking very short and sweet "how to's" for the various basic geoprocessing functions.  I have seen a little interest in Phoenix for Python geoprocessing classes for which I would love to do if there is enough interest.  I am hoping that fellow members of the DesertPy.org group will also be interested in sharing their knowledge/experiences for some more basic Python training.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As usual, if you have any questions, comments, or bitches, feel free to contact me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BR</p>
