<p>Well, I was messing with <a class="zem_slink" title="Server (computing)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">server</a> setup for <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Ruby on Rails</a> again.  I had created a script to walk thru the steps but it still seems to be a combination of try this, get an error, google the error, apply the fix, and try it again.  If it works go to next step, and if not; repeat over and over.</p>
<p>Now the best option for hosting Rails apps is <a class="zem_slink" title="Heroku" href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Heroku</a> but this is not always an option.  A lot of the other 'paid' Rails hosting options have 'one-click' server setup.  What I am talking about is setting up a brand new <a class="zem_slink" title="Ubuntu (operating system)" href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Ubuntu</a> 12.* server for Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>I will be updating my step-by-step server setup and posting that soon...</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about an awesome script that I found.  It is called <a href="https://github.com/joshfng/railsready">Railsready</a> by Josh Frye.  Out of the box it certainly kicks ass to use for setting up Rails ready server on 'Nix or <a class="zem_slink" title="OS X" href="http://www.apple.com/osx" target="_blank" rel="homepage">OSX</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I wanted more, so I added more.  I have taken Josh's fine script and added some options that I wanted.</p>
<p>I now have it setup to ask what version Ruby you want installed.  Right now that is a choice of 1.9.3 or 2.0.0.  I am planning on setting that up to prompt for which version but I worry that users will enter a non-existing patch.</p>
<p>I have also added <a class="zem_slink" title="Nginx" href="http://nginx.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Nginx</a> server install plus your choice of Unicorn, Thin or <a class="zem_slink" title="Phusion Passenger" href="http://modrails.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Passenger</a>.</p>
<p>Next up is I am going to add option to choose from <a class="zem_slink" title="MongoDB" href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Mongodb</a>, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Take a look at it and see what you think... <a href="https://github.com/brobertsaz/railsready"> https://github.com/brobertsaz/railsready</a></p>
