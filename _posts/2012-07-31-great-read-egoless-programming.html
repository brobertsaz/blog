<p>Once in a while an article comes along that really impresses me.  Please checkout <strong><a href="http://blog.stephenwyattbush.com/2012/04/07/dad-and-the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming">Dad and the Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming</a> </strong>by <a href="http://twitter.com/wyattdanger">@wyattdanger</a> .</p>
<p>What a great story and its amazing that a book written in 1971 list rules that still hold true today.  A for sure must read for programmers.</p>
