    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\n<h3 class=\"western\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Agile
    Rails Development Methodology according to a developer is to use the following
    path for <a href=\"http://railscarma.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby on Rails Application
    Development.</a>\n</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>1. </b><strong>Write
    down a list of goals, roles, and features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<li>\r\n<p
    style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Goals – what the goals of the whole project are – business
    and otherwise. This will help you decide what features are important</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p
    style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Roles – who is going to use the site – visitors, logged
    in members, <strong>admins?</strong> Do different people have different views
    of the same information on the site?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Features
    – what are the basic categories of interaction on the site? For example: Users:
    registration, using the forums, and blogging; Admins: moderating the user content</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p
    style=\"text-align:left;\">2. <strong>Write a list of stories</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul
    style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">A story is
    different than a feature because it represents a single thread of interaction
    from a particular user’s perspective.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">It’s
    common to express stories in form “As a ____ I want to ____ so that I can _____.”
    This forces you answer three important questions – Who is this for? What do they
    want to do? Why do they want to do it?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">If
    you can’t complete a story in this form, it’s likely that you don’t have an answer
    to one of these three questions yet, so you’ll need to do some thinking to get
    the answers before the story is actionable.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Ex:
    “As an admin, I want to ban users from the forum, So that I can improve the quality
    of user-submitted content on the site.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Write
    these stories down on note cards. This will help you in estimation and prioritization.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p
    style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>3. Estimate the stories</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul
    style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Estimation
    is a huge topic in itself, but the basic idea is to associate a particular level
    of effort with each story.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">The
    most common scales are 0/1/2/3/4, 0/1/2/4/8. I don’t think this is incredibly
    important, but pick something and stick with it.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p
    style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Don’t get too hung up on the exactness of the estimates.
    Lots of things affect how long it takes you to finish a story, so small differences
    in story complexity tend to get lost in the noise.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p
    style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Your goal here is to differentiate things that are
    low in effort, like stories that will result in you creating a simple model with
    a REST controller, from stories that are high in effort, like interfacing your
    application with a challenging third-party API, or a story that will require you
    to use a technology you aren’t very familiar with.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p
    style=\"text-align:left;\">Write the estimate on each card.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p
    style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>4. Prioritize the stories</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul
    style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Rearrange the
    cards in the order that you’d like to tackle the stories.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p
    style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Only the product owner can really make this decision.
    There are a lot of things that go into prioritization – deadlines, user testing,
    business value, etc. Estimation may have a lot to do with prioritization, because
    it illuminates opportunity cost. Maybe the product owner really wants that detailed
    Admin Dashboard, but if all the stories to make that work total 40 points, is
    it worth it to spend a month on just this feature. Maybe the product owner still
    wants the story</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Are there
    any stories that don’t fit into the very minimum viable product to launch? If
    so, you should move them down. Try to complete a functioning app as quickly as
    possible so you can put it in front of users.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">At
    this point, I usually move my cards into Pivotal Tracker, but I know lots of people
    who prefer pen and paper.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Read
