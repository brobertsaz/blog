<p style="text-align:justify;">EDIT:  Alright, we now have started a Geo group for Phoenix AZ.  It is a google group at <a href="http://www.phxgeo.org/">http://www.phxgeo.org</a>.  We are going to have monthly meetups every 2nd Wednesday of the month location TBD.  The group encompasses everything geo from GIS to programming.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">OK, so I have looked all over for a <a class="zem_slink" title="Python (programming language)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> user group in Arizona and I cannot find anything.  So many states have users groups but I cannot find anything.  As big of a city that Phoenix is, I find this unbelieveable.  Not only is there not a Python users group in Arizona but there is also no <a class="zem_slink" title="Geographic information system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> user group.  What is up with this?  All of the other states have something going on but we do not in Arizona.  In the programming world I have found so many people willing to assist in helping and we are in one of the largest cities in the U.S.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there is anybody that knows of a Python or GIS users group in Arizona, please let me know.  If there isn't anything out there but somebody would like to start a user group for Python or GIS, please let me know. </p>
