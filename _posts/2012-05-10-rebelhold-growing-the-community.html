<p style="text-align:justify;">Things are really going great for RebelHold these days.  We are now the largest Ruby on Rails development shop in Arizona that is still taking on new projects.  It is because of this that we have been able to help community members to grow as developers.  I was asked a while back what it is that I have ever done for the community.  I have been training one of our new apprentices and I also brought a new Intern onboard.  We also added another apprentice and our Phoenix outpost has doubled in size in the last couple of months.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also have added a couple of apprentices on in other states and are proud to be able to entertain any new RoR projects as they come along.  Our goal continues to be training our own developers.  We still do not charge to teach and in fact we pay our apprentices while they learn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feel proud to be able to help members of our community to learn RoR and earn at the same time.  I am proud to be part of RebelHold!</p>
