    class=\"reblogged-content\">There is a point in a Ruby-ist's life where you dig
    a little too deep into the depths of metaprogramming.\r\n\r\nSometimes the result
    is incredibly cool, like Rails. Rails uses a lot of metaprogramming in order to
    save you a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nFor example, there's some nifty work being done
    in order to create the find_by methods through combining method_missing and the
    Eigenclass. This particular post is about the Eigenclass but you can find a pretty
    good explanation of method_missing <a href=\"http://eugmill.com/blog/2014/05/05/ghost-methods-in-ruby-and-rails/\">here</a>.
     But for more about Eigenclass, read on. <!--more-->\r\n\r\nActive Record will
    provide dynamic finders for every known attribute on your table.\r\n\r\nSo if
    your <em>Client </em>model has a filed <em>first_name</em>, you can have find_by_first_name
    for free.\r\n\r\nCalling find_by_first_name works dynamically through the use
    of method_missing in Object. Rails overrides method_missing for Active Record
    so that the method can be dynamically defined.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n[code
    language=\"ruby\"]\r\ndef method_missing(name, *arguments, &amp;amp;block)\r\n
    \ match = Method.match(self, name)\r\n\r\n  if match &amp;amp;&amp;amp; match.valid?\r\n
    \   match.define #define the method\r\n    send(name, *arguments, &amp;amp;block)\r\n
    \ else\r\n    super\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the method
    actually gets defined:\r\n\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]\r\ndef define\r\n  model.class_eval
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;-CODE, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1\r\n  def self.#{name}(#{signature})\r\n
    \   #{body}\r\n  end\r\n  CODE\r\nend\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nSo we're defining a method
    on to a class dynamically based on the attributes, which is pretty neat. But where
    is this method? Is it somehow within the model's class?\r\n\r\nActually it's hiding
    out in the Eigenclass (or the ghost class). What the heck is this?\r\n\r\nLet's
    start with the name, which will help frame this post. Eigen means \"own\" in German/Dutch.
    Class refers to the Ruby Class. So Eigenclass would be \"own class\". Hold on
    to that, because we'll need to remember this down the line.\r\n\r\nSo first, some
    ruby code:\r\n\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]\r\nclass Animal\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass
    Dog &amp;lt; Animal\r\nend\r\n\r\nhippo = Animal.new\r\n\r\npug = Dog.new\r\npoodle
    = Dog.new\r\n\r\n#define an instance method/ singleton method\r\nclass &amp;lt;&amp;lt;
    pug\r\n  def snore\r\n    \"ZzzzZZZzzz*snort*ZZZZzzz\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\npug.snore
    #=&amp;gt; \"ZzzzZZZzzz*snort*ZZZZzzz\"\r\npoodle.snore #=&amp;gt; NoMethodError\r\nhippo.snore
    #=&amp;gt; NoMethodError\r\n\r\n#define a class's instance variable\r\nclass Dog\r\n
    \ def bark\r\n    \"Woof woof\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\npug.bark\r\npoodle.bark\r\nhippo.bark\r\n\r\n#define
    a class variable\r\nclass Dog\r\n  class &amp;lt;&amp;lt; self\r\n    def types\r\n
    \     \"Pug and Poodle\"\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nDog.singleton_methods
    #=&amp;gt; [[0] types() Dog]]\r\npoodle.singleton_methods #=&amp;gt;\r\npug.singleton_methods
    #=&amp;gt; [[0] types() Dog]]\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nIn this example, I've defined
    a class Animal and a subclass of Dog with various instances of each. As you can
    see, you can define various methods and classes on the Class level or instance
    level. These methods don't exist in the ether though. They're actually stored
    in an anonymous class associated with either the instance or the class itself.
    This anonymous class is the Eigenclass (the specific object's \"own\" class).\r\n\r\nThe
    Eigenclass is anonymous but is inherited from a superclass's eigenclass. So every
    class has its own hidden Eigenclass that the point to and ineherit from. The singleton
    methods are actually instance methods of the associated Eigenclass.\r\n\r\nHow
    is this getting used?\r\n\r\nWell let's say a Rails User model has an email attribute.
    It would be useful to find a User based on the email (Ex. User.find_by_email(\"foo@foo.com\")).
    Rails overrides method_missing so you can generate the right code to dynamically
    find the object based on a given class attribute. But even more importantly, a
    singleton method is defined on User's Eigenclass. This is applied on the class
    level but could also be applied on the instance level.\r\n\r\nPowerful stuff!</div>\";}"

<p>I never knew how this worked nor heard of Eigenclass but have used find_by....  Nice clear explanation :)</p>
