    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nTesla's Model S P85D is well known for its wonderfully
    named \"Insane\" mode, which tunes the car to go from 0 to 60 in 3.1 seconds.\r\n\r\nNot
    insane enough for you? Now the Model S is getting a \"Ludicrous\" mode. Seriously.\r\n\r\nThe
    aptly named Ludicrous mode will do 0-60 in <em>2.8 seconds</em>. According to
    Tesla CEO Elon Musk, that acceleration pins you to the seat at a 1.1 Gs. \"It's
    faster than falling,\" he adds. \"It's like having your own private roller coaster.\"\r\n\r\nOne
    catch: unlike most Tesla Model S tuning enhancements, this one isn't a software
    update — and it's not free. Why? Because Tesla had to make new, physical hardware
    to make this possible. Specifically, they had to make a fuse that didn't melt
    when you pulled ridiculously high amperages over it.\r\n\r\nThe fuse upgrade will
    be a $10k option for new buyers, and cost $5k (before installation) for existing
    P85D owners.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nMusk also announced two other bits of news surrounding
    the Model S:</strong>\r\n<ol>\n<li>They're introducing the Model S 70, a new single
    motor 70 kWH model for $70,000</li>\r\n\t<li>A $3,000 90kWh battery pack upgrade
    option for the 85kWh Model S. This upgrade is primarily meant for new buyers;
    while existing owners <em>can</em> purchase it, Elon suggests that current owners
    wait until an upgrade is necessary as the range will only improve in time.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAlso
    mentioned in passing were very limited details on Tesla's electric SUV — the Model
    X — and their more affordable compact option, the Model 3. The first Model X's
    will ship \"in two months,\" while Elon promises Model 3s will roll out \"in just
    over two years.\"\r\n\r\n<em>(Fun note: before the press call began, Tesla had
    Ludacris playing on loop — now we know why. How very Apple-y of them.)</em>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygE01sOhzz0</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:2;}"
