<p>I have been working an app that is used by many users that are still on MS XP and using IE8.  It is a javascript heavy app and I have many issues in dealing with the cross-browser compatibility (IE) but today I found a great gem.</p>
<p>I was trying everything using CSS to hide a div in IE 8 to no avail.  And then <a href="https://github.com/fnando/browser">Browser Gem</a> to the rescue.</p>
<p>I added a simple check for IE 8 in my view:</p>
<p>    = if browser.ie8?</p>
<p>Thank you browser gem!!!</p>
