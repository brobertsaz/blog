<p>I just found out today that after a long battle to get a separate forum for Python and not having all of the Python questions fall under the Geoprocessing threads, ESRI has created a new Python forum: <a href="http://forums.arcgis.com/forums/117-Python">http://forums.arcgis.com/forums/117-Python</a></p>
<p>This is for Python related threads regardless of whetherÂ it is for geoprocessing or not.</p>
