    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nToday I found out about <a href=\"http://www.railsbricks.net\">railsbricks</a>.
    It's a ruby gem that does the complicated task of setting up trivial functionality
    for your site like user logins, database configuration, admin pages, and other
    things like that. Extremely helpful in that endeavor was <a href=\"http://www.developingandrails.com/2015/02/a-social-network-in-rails-gem-by-gem.html\">this
    blog</a>Â post, which helped me parse some of the options I was presented with.\r\n\r\nI
    did run into one problem that was not covered in his post, however. It seems the
    team that makes Postgresql keep moving around their psql.conf file and that causes
    your application to flip out without some extra configuration. As this was a test
    application, I went with SQLite3 for my database for simplicity's sake.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    though, railsbricks is another extremely helpful tool in creating rails apps quickly
    and conveniently.</div>\";}"
