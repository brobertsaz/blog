    class=\"reblogged-content\">If you followed the post on setting up <a href=\"http://jibai31.wordpress.com/2013/08/07/test-your-production-environment-with-vagrant/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Vagrant</a>, you've got a nice working environment, hopefully
    quite close to the environment where your app is running live.\r\n\r\nAnd now
    you need to upgrade that environment, so you'd like to upgrade your box alongside.
    In my case, I'm upgrading my app from Ruby 1.9.2 to Ruby 2.0 on <a href=\"http://www.heroku.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">Heroku</a>, so I'd like to upgrade my Ubuntu VM too. This post
    will cover first the upgrade to Ruby 2.0, and then saving the upgraded box.\r\n\r\nFirst
    we use apt-get to ensure that all of our installed software is up to date.\r\n<pre><code>$
    sudo apt-get update</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThen we install some prerequisites: the
    build essentials, ZLib, Git.\r\n<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
    zlib1g-dev git-core</code></pre>\r\n\r\nI don't want to simply upgrade Ruby, I'd
    like to go back and forth between the 2 versions while testing the upgrade. There
    are 2 recommended tools for managing several Ruby versions: <a href=\"https://rvm.io/\"
    target=\"_blank\">RVM </a>and <a href=\"https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv\"
    target=\"_blank\">rbenv</a>. Being more familiar with RVM, that's the way I'm
    going. But do check the two options if you're interested.\r\n\r\nThis will actually
    install RVM and the latest stable Ruby version as well:\r\n<pre><code>$ curl -L
    https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby\r\n$ source /home/vagrant/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAnd
    reload your profile:\r\n<pre><code>$ source ~/.profile</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAnd
    that's it! At the time of this writing, this installed ruby-2.0.0-p247. If you
    want to switch between versions, simply run:\r\n<pre><code>$ rvm use 2.0.0</code></pre>\r\n\r\nNow
    the upgrade is done, you want to test your app. Nothing simpler. Upgrade your
    Ruby version in your Gemfile:\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]ruby '2.0.0'[/code]\r\n\r\nAnd
    reinstall all the gems for Ruby 2.0.0:\r\n<pre><code>$ bundle</code></pre>\r\n\r\nFinally,
    run the tests:\r\n<pre><code>$ bundle exec rspec spec</code></pre>\r\n\r\nAs far
    as I'm concerned, nothing breaks! I'm done with the upgrade!\r\n\r\nBut now I
    did this work to upgrade my Ubuntu VM, I'd like to back it up. So that if I happen
    to run a vagrant destroy, I can simply restore it. It turns out it's quite easy
    to do. While your VM is running, simply execute a Vagrant <a href=\"http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/package.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">package</a> command:\r\n<pre><code>$ vagrant package\r\n[default]
    Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...\r\n[default] Clearing any previously set
    forwarded ports...\r\n[default] Creating temporary directory for export...\r\n[default]
    Exporting VM...\r\n[default] Compressing package to: C:/Users/JB/myapp/package.box</code></pre>\r\n\r\nYou
    can now share this box with coworkers, or back it up for future restore.</div>\";}"

<p>Sweet, I did not know about the option to package a Vagrant box.  Thanks for this.</p>
