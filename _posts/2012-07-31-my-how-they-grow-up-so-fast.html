<p>So our intern Ricky is headed off to Korea for a bit and we will miss him.  The project that he was working of for <a href="http://rebel-outpost.com">Rebel Outpost</a> has been quite a monster legacy Rails project.  Ricky was really amazing in that he never gave in without a fight.</p>
<p>The project required an activity stream and off to Google, Ricky went.  His approach was not only a huge success but something that none of us have ever used before; Mongoid Observers.</p>
<p>He even wrote a short tutorial for it at <a href="http://www.rickcarlino.com/?p=74"><strong>So you want to make an observer in Mongoid…</strong></a></p>
<p>Thanks again Rick and hurry back!</p>
