<p>A friend of mine sent me a link today that has some good reading as far as Python training and the like.Â  Check it out at <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index</a>.</p>
<p>I especially like the "How to think like a computer Scientist" which is written specifically for Python.</p>
