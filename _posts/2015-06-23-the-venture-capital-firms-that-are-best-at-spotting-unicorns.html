    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\n<em>This post has been updated.</em>\r\n\r\nLast
    month, Quartz went hunting for the biggest \"<a href=\"http://qz.com/410348/the-biggest-unicorn-makers-in-tech-ranked/\">unicorn
    makers</a>\" in the venture capital world. By analyzing data from research firm
    Pitchbook, the goal was to find out which firms participated in rounds that directly
    pushed a startup's valuation to $1 billion or more.\r\n\r\nAccel Partners and
    Insight Venture Partners came out on top, each with seven deals that helped propel a startup
    to \"unicorn\" status. But since the scope was late-stage deals, some readers
    noted, rightly so, that these firms were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oss8/status/602865400422932480\">simply
    riding the wave</a>, investing in fast-growing-yet-established startups, such
    as <a href=\"http://qz.com/385379/slack-just-doubled-its-valuation-proving-enterprise-software-can-be-sexy/\">Slack</a>.
    For investors with deep enough pockets, it's easy to go \"<a href=\"http://goinglongblog.com/private-late-stage-valuations-skyrocketing/?utm_content=bufferf19c3&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">logo
    shopping</a>\" and invest in hot startups, solely to be associated with them.
    (The data, however, did include follow-on deals, or subsequent investments in
    startups the firms already had a stake in.)\r\n\r\nBut getting in early is often
    where the biggest returns are. Making those types of investments also requires
    guts and foresight since they're bets on startups that might have a barely working
    prototype—or perhaps just an idea.\r\n\r\nSo this time, Quartz looked at early-stage investments—seed
    and series A rounds—in startups that ultimately became billion-dollar companies,
    using Pitchbook's data from 2000 to June 10, 2015. Sequoia Capital led with 10
    investments—including LinkedIn, Dropbox, Airbnb, Stripe—followed by SV Angel with
    nine and First Round Capital with eight. (<span class=\"s1\">The data from Pitchbook
    did not include companies that eventually went public with valuations of $1 billion
    or more. For example, a representative from Sequoia said the firm invested in
    18 unicorns if public companies were included.)</span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_434296\"

    a reputation for being the <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/billion-dollar-startup-venture-capital/\">best
    at spotting unicorns</a>. When looking solely at the number of billion-dollar
    startups in its portfolio, that's true. But the firm has also invested in 653 early-stage
    companies since 2000, which results in a 1.5% unicorn-spotting rate. Almost all
    the firms that got in early with at least four unicorns tout a rate of 1% to 3%,
    with two exceptions. Y Combinator invested in the most number of early-stage startups
    (808), deflating its unicorn-spotting rate to 0.7%. The other is Union Square
    Ventures, which got in early with five startups (Etsy, Twitter, Zynga, MongoDB,
    Twilio) eventually worth at least $1 billion. It had only invested in 75 early-stage
    companies—a whopping rate of 6.7%.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_434266\" align=\"alignnone\"

    (June 23): </strong>This post has been updated to clarify that the data from Pitchbook
    did not include companies that went public with a valuation of $1 billion or more,
    and to include a comment from a Sequoia representative.\r\n<h2>Read this next:
