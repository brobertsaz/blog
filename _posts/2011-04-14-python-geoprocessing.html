<p style="text-align:justify;">Alright everybody, I get a lot of searches everyday for <a class="zem_slink" title="Python (programming language)" href="http://www.python.org/" rel="homepage">Python</a> geoprocessing related questions.  I would love to add more content about geoprocessing but not sure what it is that all of you would like to learn.  I was going to do a "Geoprocessing tip of the week" but I felt that it would be pretty much the same as looking at the <a class="zem_slink" title="Esri" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.0570416667,-117.195677778&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=34.0570416667,-117.195677778 (Esri)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">ESRI</a> help docs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The simplest way is to email me via the about/contact page and I will attempt to answer what I can.  I am also looking at putting on a Python Geoprocessing class(s) here in Phoenix at the DesertPy.org group meetups.  Would there be any interest in a Python Geoprocessing class if I were to have one?  Maybe if there is enough interest we can do a webinar so that those outside of the Phoenix area could also participate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As always, feel free to drop me a line...</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BR</p>
