<p style="text-align:justify;">So I was in my usual hunting grounds (<a href="http://rubyaz.heroku.com/">Ruby::AZ</a>) for scouting for <a class="zem_slink" title="Internship" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">interns</a>, when there sitting in the middle wide-eyed as can be, I saw my next victim.  We spoke for a bit and he said that he was just beginning to learn <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org" rel="homepage" target="_blank">RoR</a>.  He emailed me a more thorough profile of himself and we spent quite a bit of time chatting the next day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So without further ado, please welcome Steve Tong to the <a href="http://rebel-outpost.com">Rebel Outpost</a> community:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"Here is a little bit about myself to see if you are interesting in working (teaching) with me. I have business degree with a major in marketing. I have been doing marketing (mostly internet marketing) and advertising operations as a day job for about 5 years now. Side projects including email development, <a class="zem_slink" title="Black Hat Search Engine Optimization" href="http://www.techopedia.com/definition/4860/black-hat-seo" rel="techopedia" target="_blank">SEO</a> work, and the occasional website build....</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My development experience consists of a year of C# in college and about another year of dabbling around with it after. Although the only thing I really retained was logic. I have done work with HTML/CSS and have started really learning Ruby on Rails since this past May. I feel I have taught myself a lot but am definitely still a beginner and need to learn much more, and would greatly benefit having someone help me turn this into a career."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After looking at some of the work that Steve Tong has done on his own, I am highly impressed with his Rails skills.  We are happy to bring him on with his SEO skills in addition to Marketing skills and expect Steve to be a great fit and a great coder.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We all know that he has some big shoes to fit after our last intern, but I think he can do it!!</p>
