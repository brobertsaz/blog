    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nNow that my web site has been live for a couple
    of months I have had time to go back and see some improvements I can make. The
    first thing I noticed was regarding the Highchart graphs, I noticed that you could
    filter out the lines of the graph that you where not interested in by clicking
    on the related legend. So I updated the graph so that clicking on it does not
    move you to a new page which meant this useful dynamic legend filter functionality
    could be used. You can still move pages by clicking on the left hand side grid
    boxes\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_157\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a
    href=\"https://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screenshot-from-2015-03-03-214817.png\"><img
    class=\"size-medium wp-image-157\" src=\"https://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screenshot-from-2015-03-03-214817.png\"
    alt=\"Interact with the High Charts Graphs\" width=\"300\" height=\"157\" data-originalSrc=\"https://stephenemo.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screenshot-from-2015-03-03-214817.png?w=300\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\"></a> Interact with the High Charts Graphs[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe
    second thing I noticed was that smaller towns ended up with the highest price.
    This was due to the low volumes of sales in the area. This meant a single site
    valued at 600,000 pounds would give high average price as it was the only one
    available. I do need some sorted of weighted average. Any suggestions would be
    welcome.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk\">http://www.propertytrackerni.co.uk</a>\n</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"
