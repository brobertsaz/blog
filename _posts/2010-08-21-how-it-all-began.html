<p style="text-align:justify;">I started learning <a class="zem_slink" title="Python (programming language)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> for Geoprocessing last year as a "hobby" but it has gone much past that now.   I have always been someone that needs to be challenged and programming it obviously just that.... challenging.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did read a lot about Python but using it in Geoprocessing was a lot easier than just raw programming.  With the interface for ArcToolbox tools it is easier to code then writing out the entire code.  After a while I got pretty comfortable with Python Geoprocessing but I soon discovered the limitations to the "tools" that I wanted to create.  I wanted to take my tools out of geoprocessing and create more of a wizard like tool.  With a lot of help from a Perl programmer and a couple of folks that you have seen their names all over the forums, I have created my stand-alone GUI interface as I had wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From all of this comes the fact that there have been so many others that have helped me either directly or indirectly.  I have seen that there is so much info all over the web and I want to do my part to help.  Again, I have limited knowledge of Python, <a class="zem_slink" title="WxPython" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxPython">wxPython</a>, and Geoprocessing with Python.  It is because of this that I have had to learn to crawl and was astonished at some of the simpliest tasks that I wanted to do required hours upon hours of searching.  But alas, in the end it is so great to figure it out and run it without any error messages!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I will soon start adding in snippets of code for some of the basic Python, wxPython, and Geoprocessing with Python functions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there are any others out there that would like to contribute, please let me know.  I would love this to blossom into a consolidated resource for Pythonistas new and experienced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BR</p>
