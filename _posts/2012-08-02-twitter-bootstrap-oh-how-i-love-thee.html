<p style="text-align:justify;">As a person that cannot even draw a worthwhile stickman, I have to say that I do not have a designer bone in my body.  Oh I can get around HTML/HAML and CSS/SASS but other than that I am pretty hopeless as a designer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I started to use<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/"> Twitter Bootstrap</a> on a side project of mine and used it entirely for <a href="http://rebel-outpost.com">Rebel Outpost</a>.  It seems that the argument is that using it will make all sites look alike and I see that to a point.  But let me tell you the use that I found for it; I am learning to design.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Using Twitter bootstrap has improved my <a class="zem_slink" title="Haml" href="http://haml-lang.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">HAML</a> and SASS skills.  I used to give every element a different id or class and had mountains of CSS/SASS.  Now I do not do that any more.  I have learned to use grids as well.  I have started to make my own custom Twitter Bootstrap file which I can now use as a foundation to any new site.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you are like me, take a Twitter Bootstrap file, customize it and go with it as a foundation to use for your site.</p>
