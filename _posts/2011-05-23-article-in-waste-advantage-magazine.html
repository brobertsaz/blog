<p style="text-align:justify;">So today I am excited as I just found out the my Solid Waste Route Optimization paper is going to be published in the July edition of Waste Advantage magazine.  Does this make me a routing expert?  Absolutely not!  This just means that they are looking for content for their magazine!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That being said, I am excited to get my information out there for the world to see.  There have been a lot of readers that have downloaded my Solid Waste routing paper and that in itself makes me feel good that I have possibly assisted somebody that needed help!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As always, I appreciate my readers and if you ever have any questions or comments then fell free to express them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BR</p>
