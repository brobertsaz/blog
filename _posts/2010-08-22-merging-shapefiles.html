<p>Another process that I though would be quite simple was merging 2 shapefiles.  It seems there is an issue with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Shapefile" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefile</a> names not being recognized and I had to use "str" to identify the names as strings.</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="Python"]</p>
<p>temp1 = &quot;temp1.shp&quot;<br />
 temp2 = &quot;temp2.shp&quot;</p>
<p>strlist = str(temp1)+&quot;;&quot;+str(temp2)<br />
 outshp = (gp.workspace+&quot;/final.shp&quot;)<br />
 gp.Merge_management (str(strlist), outshp)<br />
 gp.AddMessage (&quot;Merged Shapefiles&quot;)</p>
<p>[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>When I tried to just use the names of the shapefile copies I could not get this to work.  I then created a simple list and identified the shapefile names as strings as well as in the actual Merge_managment, I had to identify the strlist as string.</p>
