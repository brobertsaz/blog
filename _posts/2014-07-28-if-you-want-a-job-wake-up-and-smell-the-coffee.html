    not a techie per se.Â  Many of us enjoy technology and believe that we are well
    versed in it.Â  But, I would call that the End-User Syndrome.Â  That is, we enjoy
    the benefits of our smart phones and mobile devices.Â  We love to be able to do
    all sorts of things online, including looking up answers quickly, making purchases,
    and paying bills (OK, thatâ\x80\x99s not so much fun).Â  However, few of us would
    ever be interested in assembling hardware or even writing the code which drives
    the Internet or the apps we use.\r\n\r\nToday, I had an opportunity to meet with
    recruiters Alexa and Lee at a technology recruiting company in my area.Â  Following
    an explanation of what I do, I asked them about their staffing needs.Â  I also
    asked them what areas were hard-to-find and therefore represent <strong>opportunities</strong>
    for current and future job seekers in our community.Â  They replied, practically
    in stereo, â\x80\x9C<strong>Javaâ\x80\x9D!</strong>Â  And they did not mean the
    kind from Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.Â  I then asked them to list other areas
    of IT and we came up with the list which appears below.\r\n\r\nCaveat:Â  I mentioned
    that I am not a techie, right?Â  So, I cannot say that I am conversant with these
    languages or platforms.Â  I canâ\x80\x99t say that I fully understand the descriptions
    which I gathered from my research.Â  But, what I can say is that based on this
    recent meeting and the information I have gleaned from other IT professionals,
    these represent current, imminent, and future skill areas which are in demand.Â 
    The Baltimore-Washington corridor is full of government employers, contractors,
    and commercial technology companies who are starving for these skill sets.Â  There
    are many quality jobs out there which are ripe for the taking, if people would
    have these skills.Â  Within Information Technology (â\x80\x9CITâ\x80\x9D) the
    unemployment rates range from less than 1% to just over 3%, which is<strong> half</strong>
    of the national rates.Â  See <a href=\"http://media.dice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-Q1-Tech-Trends-Link.pdf\">this
    graphic</a>.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore be important for parents of young people
    to pay attention to what is out there by way of available jobs and those skills
    which will be needed for kids to achieve gainful employment.Â  Peruse job descriptions
    and titles.Â  Look at the experiential and education requirements.Â  Young people
    should be encouraged to learn these areas early and often, in school and at home.\r\n\r\nSo
    in that spirit, I am presenting some areas which came up during my meeting, starting
    with the coffee (which they did offer me, by the way), or more importantly Java.\r\n\r\n<strong>Java</strong>
    (not to be confused with Java Script) is a programming language that is concurrent,
    class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation
    dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers \"write
    once, run anywhere\" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does
    not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled
    to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless
    of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2014, one of the most popular programming
    languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported
    9 million developers. The language derives much of its origins from C and C++,
    but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ruby
    on Rails</strong> (or â\x80\x9C<strong>Rails</strong>â\x80\x9D) is an open source
    full-stack web application framework written in the Ruby Programming Language.
    Rails is capable of gathering information using pages and applications from the
    web server and can interact with a database and can retrieve information from
    the database. Rails works as routing system that works independently from the
    underlying web server. Rails is designed to make building web applications simpler
    by utilizing convention over configuration. In doing so Rails greatly simplifies
    the creation of certain applications while complicating the creation of others.\r\n\r\n<strong>Python
    </strong>is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its
    design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers
    to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages
    such as C. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs
    on both a small and large scale.\r\n\r\n<strong>Extensible Markup Language</strong>
    (or â\x80\x9C<strong>XML</strong>â\x80\x9D) is a markup language that defines
    a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable
    and machine-readable. It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification produced by the
    W3C, and several other related specifications, all free open standards.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cloud</strong>
    computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby
    shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other
    devices as a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network (typically the
    Internet). Clouds can be classified as public, private or hybrid.Â  The term \"moving
    to cloud\" also refers to an organization moving away from a traditional CAPEX
    model (buy the dedicated hardware and depreciate it over a period of time) to
    the OPEX model (use a shared cloud infrastructure and pay as one uses it).\r\n\r\n<strong>MapReduce</strong>
    is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating
    large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.Â  A MapReduce
    program is composed of a Map procedure that performs filtering and sorting (such
    as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and a
    Reduce procedure that performs a summary operation (such as counting the number
    of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). The \"MapReduce System\"
    (also called \"infrastructure\" or \"framework\") orchestrates the processing
    by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel,
    managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the
    system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.\r\n\r\n<strong>Apache
    HTTP Server</strong> (or â\x80\x9C<strong>Apache</strong>â\x80\x9D) is a web server
    application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World
    Wide Web.[3] Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server, development of Apache
    began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled. Apache quickly overtook
    NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and has remained the most popular HTTP
    server in use since April 1996. In 2009, it became the first web server software
    to serve more than 100 million websites.\r\n\r\n<strong>Apache Hadoop</strong>
    is an open-source software framework for storage and large-scale processing of
    data-sets on clusters of commodity hardware. Hadoop is an Apache top-level project
    being built and used by a global community of contributors and users.Â  It is
    licensed under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\n<strong>Pig Script</strong> (or
    â\x80\x9C<strong>Pig</strong>â\x80\x9D) is a high-level platform for creating
    MapReduce programs used with Hadoop. The language for this platform is called
    Pig Latin. Pig Latin abstracts the programming from the Java MapReduce idiom into
    a notation which makes MapReduce programming high level, similar to that of SQL
    for RDBMS systems. Pig Latin can be extended using UDF (User Defined Functions)
    which the user can write in Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby or Groovy and then
    call directly from the language.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe $64,000 question is from
    where and how skills in these areas are to be obtained?Â  Well, a first step is
    to get our youth interested in IT fields such as <strong>programming</strong>
    (or â\x80\x9C<strong>coding</strong>â\x80\x9D).Â  Here are some helpful resources
    for parents.Â  For parents of younger children, see <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/how-and-why-to-teach-your-kids-to-code-510588878\">here</a>.Â 
    For older children, there are a bunch of often <strong>free </strong>online tutorials
    which can be accessed <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.codeschool.com/\">here</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\">here</a>.Â  For information on the
    up-and-coming specialization of <strong>robotics</strong>, please see <a href=\"http://mindstorms.lego.com/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nAnother
    step is to encourage local educational entities to get on board in terms of added
    focus and classes.Â  Our middle and high schools, colleges, and experiential training
    environments need to be encouraged to offer classes these areas.Â  These classes
    will serve to expose students to as well as hopefully cultivate interest in IT
    (I have previously expressed the same for all of STEM fields.)Â  Given the current
    and emerging opportunities in the Baltimore-Washington area, this would serve
    to align our youth with a path towards gainful employment.\r\n\r\nAnother step
    is to seek out training opportunities.Â  These might come in the form of experiential
    scenarios like internships and entry-level jobs in IT.Â  Since much of what goes
    on in IT is gained on the job, exposure to current and emerging technologies might
    be more important than what could be taught in a classroom.Â  This does not obviate
    the need to consider degree programs or industry recognized certifications in
    various technologies.Â  For some jobs, an IT degree is required and will often
    be critical to career growth to management or higher-level positions.\r\n\r\nOne
    comment which I frequently get from parents and young people is â\x80\x9Cif the
    technology is constantly changing, what I learn or train on today will be obsolete
    by the time I will be looking for a jobâ\x80\x9D.Â  While that might sound logically
    true, it is in fact erroneous.Â  What a person learns today will provide the foundation
    of the fundamentals for how things work within IT.Â  Therefore, exposure and experience
    today will lay the groundwork for the future.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I will add a
    few points:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Qualified IT professionals are in very high demand, and
    will be, for the foreseeable future. There are many vacancies and recruiters struggle
    to find suitable people to fill them.Â  However, not all credentials are the same.Â 
    Degrees from accredited, recognized, and respected institutions will always garner
    significantly more interest from employers than certifications from dubious ones.</li>\r\n\t<li>IT
    degrees are a great investment. To earn such a credential requires much less investment
    of time than the training required in obtaining comparable levels of employment
    and compensation.Â  A solid Bachelorâ\x80\x99s degree in IT will usually result
    in positive job prospects upon graduation.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Baltimore-DC area
    has many government bureaus, security agencies, and contractors. Because many
    such employers require U.S. Citizenship as a requirement, people born in the U.S.
    are often at an advantage, if they are qualified technically.Â  Furthermore, those
    born in this country may have an easier time being issued a Security Clearance,
    which is also required for many well-paying IT positions.Â  So, the combination
    of technical training, skills and being from this area will make for a very compelling
    resume.</li>\r\n\t<li>The incredible popularity of portable computing made possible
    by smart phones and mobile devices will only increase as new devices and technologies
    are introduced. Consequently the skills listed above will be even more marketable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe
    world is rapidly changing and so is IT, perhaps even more so.Â  In a very different
    context during my years in summer camp, we were told that â\x80\x9Clearning never
    endsâ\x80¦clean-up begins right nowâ\x80\x9D.Â  For IT as well, this is so true.Â 
    The proper perspective is to not only gain skills at the entry-level but maintain
    currency.Â  This requires a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability to
    whatever comes down the pike.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[Blogger's note: I wish to thank
    Alexa, Lee, and Sam for their helpful technical inputÂ in preparing this, as well
    as Wikipedia for translating many of the technical terms into plainer English.]</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"

<p>As a Rails Developer and one that hires developers, I can attest to "the unemployment rates range from less than 1% to just over 3%"</p>
