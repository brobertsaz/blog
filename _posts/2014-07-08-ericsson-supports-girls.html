    that is. If you have never heard of it before, RailGirls' aim is to give tools
    and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas. TheyÂ do
    this by providing a great experience on building things and by making technology
    more approachable.\r\n\r\nRails Girls was born in Finland, but is nowadays a global,
    non-profit volunteer community, and recently held an event in Galway which Ericsson
    supported with sponsorship and engineers.\r\n\r\nIf you missed it, don't worry,
    I'm sure there will be future events soon, but in the meantime, this might give
    you a feeling forÂ one ofÂ the events if you think RailGirls might be for you
    and you think you might like to attend:\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">[embed]https://www.flickr.com/photos/125815366@N08/14498110082/in/set-72157644933693558/[/embed]\r\nEricsson
