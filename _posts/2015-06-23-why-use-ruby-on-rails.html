    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nWhen it comes to having software developed, thereâ\x80\x99s
    no lack of options when it comes to the technologies you can use. But depending
    on what you need your application to do, certain technologies are going to be
    a better match. For most of the custom applications to build, a lot of developersÂ use
    Ruby on Rails. Hereâ\x80\x99s a quick background on Rails, why its a good match
    for most web applications, and why you might want to consider it if you have a
    web application project in mind.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\"

    alt=\"Ruby on Rails\" width=\"426\" height=\"291\"></a> Ruby On Rails[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn
    cases, business owners needed something much more customized, with specific features
    based on their business needs. When this comes up in business, my go-to tool for
    building these types of web applications is Ruby on Rails.\r\n<blockquote>Note:
    I want to be clear that Iâ\x80\x99m not necessarily saying that Rails is the best
    option for all types of projects. But for most web applications, it includes the
    functionality and features necessary to quickly develop this type of software.</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Quick
    Background on Ruby on Rails</h3>\r\nRuby on Rails is whatâ\x80\x99s called a â\x80\x9Cweb
    frameworkâ\x80\x9D written in a programming language called â\x80\x9CRubyâ\x80\x9D
    (hence the name). The term â\x80\x9Cweb frameworkâ\x80\x9D just means that Ruby
    on Rails is a collection of tools, libraries, and additions to the Ruby programming
    language that enable developers to quickly create web-based software. It was developed
    by a company called 37signals and is used on tens of thousands of websites, including
    Github, Shopify, Groupon, LivingSocial, YellowPages and more.\r\n\r\n \r\n<h3>3
    Reasons Why to Use Ruby on Rails</h3>\r\nRuby on Rails can make it more affordable
    to create and maintain web-based software. Here are some of the main reasons for
    using Ruby on Rails for your web application project:\r\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Faster
    development time</strong>: Ruby on Rails was created with a concept in mind called
    â\x80\x9Cconvention over configurationâ\x80\x9D. In some other technologies, developers
    need to spend a significant amount of time making decisions about how an application
    will be setup (e.g., file structure for the project, how code will talk to the
    database, or various settings in configuration files).The Rails approach is that
    it comes with these decisions already made, by way of â\x80\x9Csensible defaultsâ\x80\x9D
    or conventions that work well in the majority of applications. That means developers
    can spend the bulk of their time on the unique aspects of the problem theyâ\x80\x99re
    trying to solve by creating their application, not the mundane aspects of setting
    it up.\r\n\r\nRails also embraces a concept known as â\x80\x9Cdonâ\x80\x99t repeat
    yourselfâ\x80\x9D or DRY. The idea behind DRY is that you shouldnâ\x80\x99t duplicate
    your code. Instead, you should organize it in such a way that code needed in multiple
    places can be written once, then shared wherever its needed.\r\n\r\nThis helps
    avoid â\x80\x9Ccopy/paste codingâ\x80\x9D and makes maintaining code and making
    changes easier down the road. And while DRY is not a concept unique to Rails (or
    Ruby for that matter), it is a best practice on which the the Rails community
    places a high value.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Modular design</strong>: Rails also
    has a modular design. Itâ\x80\x99s common in most programming languages to find
    libraries that allow you to add specific functionality to your software and Ruby
    / Rails are no different. Rubyâ\x80\x99s libraries are called â\x80\x9Cgemsâ\x80\x9D
    and can be used to add all sorts of functionality to your web applications.You
    can think of gems as something similar to plugins in WordPress, except they generally
    allow a developer to more easily add features versus being something that the
    end user can add and use directly.\r\n\r\nSome common gems I use include adding
    features for:\r\n<ul>\n<li>User login / logout functionality</li>\r\n\t<li>Creating
    PDF files</li>\r\n\t<li>Displaying information on Google Maps</li>\r\n\t<li>Integrating
    with social media sites like Twitter and Facebook</li>\r\n\t<li>Integrating with
    third-party services (email newsletter services, text messaging, etc)</li>\r\n</ul>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Automated
    Testing</strong>: Another thing the Rails community is passionate about is testing.
    And although testing can be taken too far, in general it is absolutely a good
    idea and something I incorporate with all of the code I write.Its common to have
    features that are complex enough that they need to be broken up into separate
    parts. As you build each part, you want to be that it works like it should. And
    you also want to be sure that as you continue building on new functionality, you
    donâ\x80\x99t break what was already working.\r\n\r\nThatâ\x80\x99s essentially
    what automated testing allows you to do, by writing code that tests your application.
    That test code can be run with a single command and can quickly test all of the
    various cases for your application to be sure everything is still working correctly.
    This is significantly better (and more accurate) than just clicking around in
    a web browser testing things out.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<h3>Faster Development, Easier
    Maintenance</h3>\r\nThe bottom line is that Rails is optimized for creating feature-rich
    web applications in minimal time. Thereâ\x80\x99s a large ecosystem of libraries
    for more common functionality you might need in a web appâ\x80¦and a skilled developer
    can create their own libraries if needed. New features can be added quickly and
    maintaining applications over time can also be more cost-effective.\r\n\r\nI am
