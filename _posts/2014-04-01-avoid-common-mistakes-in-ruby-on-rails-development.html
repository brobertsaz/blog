    class=\"reblogged-content\">Many programmers face similar problems over and over.
    So, here I am going to list out the common mistakes that can be avoided in <a
    title=\"Ruby on Rails Development\" href=\"http://www.allerin.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby
    on Rails Development</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Database column Indexing</strong>\r\nAt
    the beginning of programming , mostly during writing migrations, we forget to
    add indexes , which may or may not have any effect in initial stages of application,
    but will have drastic delay in fetching records from the database as the table
    size increases.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. ActiveRecord transaction for saving multiple
    object</strong>\r\nWhenever saving multiple objects in a single request, always
    use ActiveRecord::Base::transaction method to support atomicity. So, if any record
    has not saved the entire transaction, will get rolled back and nothing will be
    saved into the database.\r\nAlways add indexes to the column being used for searching
    records.\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Example:</span>\r\n<pre>ActiveRecord::Base.transaction
    do\r\n  @tasks.each do |task|\r\n    task.save!\r\n  end\r\nend</pre>\r\n<strong>3.
    Using delete_all instead of destroy_all</strong>\r\nActiveRecord::Base::delete_all
    or ActiveRecord::Base#delete method deletes the record(s) from the database without
    firing any callback. So, This method must be used sensibly.\r\nWhere as ActiveRecord::Base::destroy_all
    or ActiveRecord::Base#destroy executes before_destroy and after_destroy callbacks.\r\n\r\n<strong>4.
    Using IN sub-queries</strong>\r\nRelational Database supports different types
    of sub-queries. Unfortunately, one of them is a performance disaster.\r\n\r\nIN
    and NOT IN sub-queries.\r\nStatic array in these queries are fine, but when used
    sub-query inside, it reduces the performance and also there are limitation on
    the number of elements in these queries depending on different databases.\r\n\r\nDo
    Not use queries like IN or NOT IN\r\n\r\nThese queries must be written using EXISTS
    or NOT EXISTS predicates to avoid serious performance issues.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Note:</span>
    Oracle optimizes IN fairly well same as EXITS, So both can be used. But not the
    same case with NOT IN vs NOT EXISTS. Better to use NOT EXISTS even on Oracle instead
    of NOT IN predicate.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Storing Session in database</strong>\r\nIt
    is very easy to store session data in relational databases, but it is the most
    expensive thing.\r\nSession data are stored and retrieved more frequently and
    can create scenario when the database can go unresponsive for the more important
    work to be done.\r\nIf there is a need of database for string session data, then
    use 'Memcache' or 'Redis'.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Set the primary key explicitly for
    database views</strong>\r\nSometimes we need to make use of database views for
    complex data joined from different tables, to reduce the overheads of fetching
    data in a single query and also to support the searching and sorting based on
    the columns of joined tables.\r\n\r\nAlways set the primary key explicitly in
    the respective model, this will provide the flexibility to define association
    with other models.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Example:</span>\r\n<pre>Class
    UserDetailsView &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  self.table_name = :user_details #
    user_details is a view in database\r\n  self.primary_key = :id # view_contains
    id from the joind user table and can be used as primary key for this model\r\nend</pre>\r\n<strong>7.
    Use find_each</strong>\r\nDo not use each method for iterating large set of records(ActiveRecord::Relation).
    It will fetch all the record in a single query from the database and will dump
    into the memory, causing\r\nperformance degradation if the there is not enough
    memory. So, better make use of find_each method, this method not only etches record
    in batches from the database but yields those once at a time too. Once the current
    batch is processed another batch will be fetched from the database. So no need
    to have all the records at once in the memory.\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Example:</span>\r\n<pre>Book.where(:published
    =&gt; true).find_each do |book|\r\n  puts \"Do something here!\"\r\nend</pre>\r\n<strong>8.
    Make use of Ranges instead of comparisons for numbers</strong>\r\nNo more if x
    &gt; 1000 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 2000 nonsense. Instead:\r\n<pre> year = 1972\r\n case
    year\r\n   when 1970..1979: \"Seventies\"\r\n   when 1980..1989: \"Eighties\"\r\n
    \  when 1990..1999: \"Nineties\"\r\n end</pre>\r\n<strong>9. Use pluck instead
    of map&lt;/strong&gt;</strong>\r\nWe often need to find a single column from the
    database, So many of us make use of map method on ActiveRecord::Relation.\r\nLike:\r\n<pre>User.active.select(:name).map(&amp;amp;:name)</pre>\r\nOr,
    even worse:\r\n<pre>User.active.map(&amp;amp;:name)</pre>\r\nInstead use pluck
    method:\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Example:</span>\r\n<pre>User.active.pluck(:name)</pre>\r\n<strong>10.
    Allow both single item and and array to make use of the same loop without condition</strong>\r\nI
    have observed that few folks write something like this\r\n<pre>(items.is_a?(Array)
    ? Items : [items]).each do |item|\r\n  #------------------\r\nend</pre>\r\nInstead
    use following:\r\n<pre>*items].each do |item|\r\n  #------------------\r\nend</pre>\r\nAbove
    code will take care of items containing either a single object or array.\r\n\r\n<strong>11.
    Rescue to the rescue</strong>\r\nUse rescue for one liner statements which may
    throw error instead of condition:\r\n<pre>hsh = {:age =&gt; 50}\r\nhsh[:name].downcase
    #=&gt; Error\r\nhsh[:name].try(:downcase) #=&gt; nil</pre>\r\nOr, even worse:\r\n<pre>hsh[:name]
    ? hsh[:name].downcase : nil #=&gt; nil</pre>\r\nInstead use as below:\r\n<pre>hsh[:name].downcase
    rescue nil #=&gt; nil</pre>\r\nOR\r\n<pre>hsh[:name].to_s.downcase #=&gt; ''</pre>\r\n<strong>12.
    Try to reduce redundancy using Ruby's logic</strong>\r\nmethod for checking odd
    number:\r\n<pre>def odd?(x)\r\n  x % 2 == 0 ? false : true\r\nend</pre>\r\nInstead
    make use of Ruby logics and simply it somewhat more.\r\n<pre>def odd?(x)\r\n  x
    % 2 != 0\r\nend</pre>\r\n<strong>13. ActiveRecord::Base::exists</strong>\r\nSometime
    we just need to check for existence of any record in the database. And I have
    seen coders are writing something like:\r\nTo check whether published books are
    present in the database or not:\r\n<pre>books = Book.where(:published =&gt; true)\r\nbooks.count
    &gt; 0 # will return true if published books exists in database.</pre>\r\nInstead
    use ActiveRecord::Base::exists method as:\r\n<pre>Book.exists?(:published =&gt;
    true)</pre>\r\n<strong>14. SQL Injection</strong>\r\n\r\nNever interpolate the
    input from the outside world into ActiveRecord query directly.\r\n<pre>query =
    \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '#{name}' AND password = '#{password'} LIMIT
    1\"\r\nresults = User.connection.execute(query)</pre>\r\nAbove query will behave
    unexpected whenever a sql injection string is passed and name nad password:\r\n<span
    style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Example:</span>\r\n<pre>name: ' OR 'a' =
    'a\r\npassword: ' OR 'a' = 'a</pre>\r\nabove input will generate query something
    like\r\n<pre>SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR 'a' = 'a' AND password = ''
    OR 'a' = 'a' LIMIT 1</pre>\r\nAnd above query will always return a user. Instead
    make use of 'where' or 'find_by' methods these will automatically escape the commas('/‚Äù)
    in the input value and will not allow query to return true and will check the
    record in database exactly what it had been passed as name and password.\r\n\r\n<strong>15.
    N+1 queries</strong>\r\nSo, Basically it happens when we load a bunch of objects
    from the database, and then for each one of those objects we make 1 or more database
    query.\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Example:</span>\r\n<pre>class
    Customer { where(active: true) }\r\nend</pre>\r\n<pre>class Address &lt; ActiveRecor...\r\nbelongs_to
    :customer\r\nend</pre>\r\n<pre>@customers = Customer.active</pre>\r\n<pre># this
    is fine the customer object is already in memory\r\n# this one fires one query
    to the database for finding Address record for each custome</pre>\r\nSuppose we
    have 100 active customers then total database queries will be 101.\r\n1 query
    for finding all the active customers and other 100 queries for finding an address
    for each.\r\nInstead try eager_loading and just fire 2 queries for all.\r\n<pre>@customers
    = Customer.active.includes(:address)</pre>\r\nThe above query will fire 1 query
    for finding all the customers and other query for finding all the address associated
    to the clients fetched in the first query.\r\n\r\nReference Post : http://www.allerin.com/blog/common-mistakes-in-ror\r\nFor

<p>Pretty nice write up.  I never saw the find_each before.  Will have to try that out :)</p>
