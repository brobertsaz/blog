<p style="text-align:justify;">So it has been in the plans since it's inception, that Rebelhold would eventually morph into multiple "outposts" or "locations".  In the last couple of weeks, this has begun to transpire.  I was excited to recently create the "Rebel Outpost" group.  Additionally, Michael, after moving back to Michigan, created the "Deep Woods Brigade."  Fletcher is planning on creating his own group as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are proud to be rolling out <a href="http://rebel-outpost.com">rebel-outpost.com</a>.  We are still a member of the RebelHold family and for lack of a better explanation, we consider ourselves a subsidiary.  Our plan still remains to have a pool of resources with different specialties available across the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are interested in discussing your project ideas or interested in interning at one of our locations, please let us know.</p>
