<p>It amazes me how often I am contacted by recruiters looking for direct hire developers in cities that I would never move to.  I have blogged about remote workers before but I still do not see companies moving to hire them.</p>
<p>So, from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Harvard Business Review" href="http://www.hbr.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Harvard Business Review</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/are_you_taking_your_people_for.html">Why Remote Workers Are More (Yes, More) Engaged</a></p>
<p>If you cannot find direct hires in your city, well then look for remote workers.  It really is that simple!!</p>
