    alt=\"\" width=\"659\" height=\"524\">U.S. businesses will spend half a billion
    dollars hiring remote freelance workers in2014.\"The growth is a clear indicator
    of a transition of work online,\" says Fabio Rosati, CEO of Elance-oDesk.The company's
    platform - which serves as a broker between companies that need skills and freelancers
    eager to supply them - sees 2.7 million freelance jobs posted a year. According
    to the company, the total earnings of freelancers have grown 50% compounded annually
    over the past five years.From Rosati's perspective, so many businesses are hiring
    these workers because they need work done on demand, often for a short stint.
    In those cases, a marketplace like Elance-oDesk becomes like the Amazon Prime
    for jobs. It's a win for the employer, who can hire on an as-needed basis, and
    for the worker, who has flexibility of schedule and location.\r\n<p class=\"p1\">What's
    more, freelancers with the right skills can earn a great living from the comfort
    of their homes - if the highest-paying freelance jobs are any indicator.</p>\r\n<p
