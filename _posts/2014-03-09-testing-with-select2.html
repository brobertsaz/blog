<p>I posted a while back about using the select2-rails gem together with the select2-capistrano gem.  I recently upgraded an app and found that my tests that were using select2 were all failing.  I did some googling and it seems that the select2-capistrano gem is no longer active.</p>
<p>Well, I went about it another way then.</p>
<p>First off, I do not add the class to each drop-down select but rather I do it globally using a collection_select_input.rb file in app/inputs/ like so:</p>
<p>[code language="ruby"]<br />
    class CollectionSelectInput &amp;lt; SimpleForm::Inputs::CollectionSelectInput<br />
      def input_html_classes<br />
        super.push(&#039;chosen-select&#039;)<br />
      end<br />
    end<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So when I started to have issues with capybara not being able to use the select2 drop-down my fix was to only use the global push if not in test environment:</p>
<p>[code language="ruby"]<br />
    class CollectionSelectInput &amp;lt; SimpleForm::Inputs::CollectionSelectInput<br />
      unless Rails.env.test?<br />
        def input_html_classes<br />
          super.push(&#039;chosen-select&#039;)<br />
        end<br />
      end<br />
    end<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So now I have good old normal drop downs in test environment and the ever awesome select2 drop downs in production.</p>
