    to thank the various people who have showed support for my TDD series last week,
    I sincerely appreciate the re-tweets and favorites!\r\n\r\nOver the weekend, while
    perusing the web I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop\"
    target=\"_blank\">Rubocop</a>. Running Rubocop looks a lot like running Rspec
    or Test::Unit in our terminal. Instead of running our specs though, Rubocop will
    generate 'cops' alerting us to various style-guide offenses, the gem even has
    an auto correct feature in experimentation at the moment. My thoughts in two words
    or less about Rubocop, pretty sweet! Lets take a look at how to use Rubocop as
    I attempt to refactor lunch_panoply and see if we can't clean up some of the rough
    edges.\r\n<h3>Rubocop Setup</h3>\r\nThe setup is extremely easy, all we do is
    type <code>gem install rubocop</code> from our command-line, or if you're using
    Bundler you can add <code>gem 'rubocop'</code> to your Gemfile, and install it
    by typing <code>bundle install</code> in your terminal.\r\n\r\nIn order to run
    Rubocop on a specific file, we can just pass the path to file after the <code>rubocop</code>
    command like so:  <code>rubocop models/model_name.rb</code>.\r\n\r\nThats all
    there is to it! To run Rubocop, we can think of how we run Zeus or Rspec in our
    terminal. From our application's root in the terminal we type <code>rubocop</code>
    to find out what our offenses will be. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lunch_panoply6_img1.jpg\"><img

    data-rehosted=\"1\"></a>\r\n\r\nRunning the command above generates offenses.\r\n\r\n<a

    Rubocop had a field day with my <code>venue_spec</code> file. Lets get on top
    of addressing a few of these. Rubocop has 3 different types of 'cops'. I think
    of cops as specs, but instead of creating them myself as I test-drive, they're
    already built into the gem and alert us to three things about our code.\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Style</li>\r\n<li>Lint</li>\r\n<li>Rails</li>\r\n</ol>\n<strong>Style</strong>:
    Style cops check for stylistics problems in our code, nearly all of these are
    based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby
    Style Guide.</a>\r\n<strong>Lint</strong>: Lint cops check for bad practices and
    errors in our code. \r\n<strong>Rails</strong>: Rails cops are specific to the
    Rails framework. These are the only cops not used by default. \r\n\r\nWe can single
    out Lint cops when desiring to discover offenses by passing in an <code> -l </code>
    argument when entering the <code>rubocop</code> command like \r\nso: <code>rubocop
    -l spec/models/venue_spec.rb</code>\r\n\r\nRails cops aren't used by default when
    entering the <code>rubocop</code> command, in order to add them to the party,
    we must specifically request them like so: \r\n<code>rubocop -R models/model_name.rb</code>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rubocop
    in Action</h3>\r\n\r\nNow that we have some of the basics covered lets take this
    out for a spin. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lunch_panoply6_img3.jpg\"><img
    src=\"http://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lunch_panoply6_img3.jpg\"
    alt=\"lunch_panoply6_img3\" width=\"649\" height=\"213\" class=\"aligncenter size-full
    wp-image-1471\" data-originalSrc=\"http://projectramon.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lunch_panoply6_img3.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\"></a>\r\n\r\n230 offenses detected Yuck! As we can see from
    the image above, all of these offenses are due to the <code>style</code> cops
    not aren't happy about tabs being used instead of spaces. I have my sublime text
    2 formatted to spaces already as far as I know, so I'm not sure as to why we're
    generating fake offenses. Luckily we can run the same command again with our <code>Lint</code>
    argument to gain a clear picture of the error-related offenses only. Typing <code>rubocop
    -l spec/models/menu_item_spec.rb</code> returns the following output:\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lunch_panoply6_img4.jpg\"><img
    src=\"http://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lunch_panoply6_img4.jpg\"
    alt=\"lunch_panoply6_img4\" width=\"676\" height=\"105\" class=\"aligncenter size-full
    wp-image-1472\" data-originalSrc=\"http://projectramon.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lunch_panoply6_img4.jpg\"
    data-rehosted=\"1\"></a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Consensus</h3>\r\n\r\nMy first impression
    of this gem is thumbs up! There are a few things I'd like to look into about reducing
    or eliminating false offenses being generated on the style front, but overall
    Rubocop is an extremely easy to setup, and quick to implement way to deoderize
    your code base. \r\n\r\nRubocop shouldn't overshadow the <a href=\"https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide\"

    by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbatsov\" target=\"_blank\">Bozhidar Batsov</a>.
    \r\n\r\nIt really makes my day when I run across other developer's creations,
    especially ones that aid with my goal for me of becoming competent enough for
    employment with a company that values the ongoing process of learning. Keeping
    our code neat and tidy, is one of many things that I am hoping will allow me to
    appear desirable as I look for entry-level work.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself desiring
    to improve the way your code appears to others, take some time and check out <a
