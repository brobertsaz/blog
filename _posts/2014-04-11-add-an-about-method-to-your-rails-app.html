    class=\"reblogged-content\">I end up using Ruby on Rails apps as tools within
    larger projects, not as an end to a web application need.  As such, my involvement
    with my Rails app may go months between those intensive times where my head is
    in the Rails app, and I forget many of the nuances and whys of the architecture.
     So I recently built up a little extra goodness in my current project to help
    me when I return to it next time.\r\n\r\nIn short, I have added to each model
    a \"description\" method that just (now anyway) prints out my thinking about what
    the model is there for and how it is to be used, what caveats exist in the model,
    and so on.  So if my app has a Product model, I can work in the Rails console
    with it and issue a Product.description call to print out all that stored human
    knowledge.\r\n\r\nThat begs for an app-wide refresher, so I added a method via
    an initializer file: about.\r\n\r\nLet's have a look!\r\n\r\n<em>app/models/product.rb</em>\r\n<pre>class
    Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  def self.description\r\n    puts \"Instances
    of the Product class......\"\r\n  end\r\nend</pre>\r\nconfig/initializers/my_stuff.rb\r\n<pre>def
    about\r\n  Dir.glob(\"#{Rails::root}/app/models/*.rb\").each do |rb|\r\n    thisModelName
    = rb.split(\"/\").last.split(\".\").first.camelcase\r\n    thisModel = thisModelName.constantize\r\n
    \   puts \"\"\r\n    puts \"++++ #{thisModelName}\"\r\n    if thisModel.respond_to?(:description)
    then\r\n      thisModel.description\r\n    end\r\n<b>    </b>puts thisModel.inspect\r\n<b>
    \   </b>puts \"----\"\r\n<b>    </b>end\r\n<b>  </b>return true\r\nend</pre>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nProgramming
    is a discipline, right? And so it takes discipline to always add a description
    method to your models, but it's really beneficial either when you come back to
    work on the Rails side of your project or you are bringing additional help in
    to work on it with you.\r\n\r\nTo build this feature I had to learn how to take
    a string and turn it into a class name.  This discussion deserves the credit for
    showing me how to accomplish this: <a title=\"Getting a class object in Ruby from
    a string containing that class’ name\" href=\"http://infovore.org/archives/2006/08/02/getting-a-class-object-in-ruby-from-a-string-containing-that-classes-name/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Getting a class object in Ruby from a string containing that
    class' name</a>\n</div>\";}"

<p>Man, after dealing with legacy code so many times, this is a great idea.  Many times developers forget (or don't care?) about the next developer that will work on the code someday.  This would be good to throw into a rake task to create the full list of descriptions.  Thanks for this!!</p>
