<p>So I was getting this crazy value for the total time to run my <a class="zem_slink" title="RSpec" href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Rspec</a> tests.  It was like a bizarre decimal.  I never really cared until I started to try to speed up my tests.</p>
<p>It took me longer to find the solution than it took to fix it.  If you are not getting a actual positive number in Rspec tests it might be Timecop.  We are using Timecop and the time was frozen, hence the crazy total time.  After running a test using Timecop, just add Timecop.return.</p>
<p>Piece of cake!!</p>
