<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#750a3c;font-family:Garamond;font-size:16pt;">Right Turns<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A common concept in solid waste collection is to minimize left turns and maximize right turns.  Interestingly, these days it is done more for safety than efficiency â€” eliminating or minimizing the dangerous left hand turns results in fewer instances the solid waste collection vehicle will have to turn in front of traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An excerpt from<em> Businessweek</em> article on March 5, 2007 called "How Technology Delivers for UPS" says it  succinctly:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"Not so long ago, UPS drivers worked off maps, 3-x-5 note cards, and their own memory to figure out the best way to run their routes. That changed in 2005 when UPS began to implement a $600 million route optimization system--think MapQuest on steroids--that each evening maps out the next day's schedule for the majority of its 56,000 drivers. So sophisticated is the software that it designs each route to minimize the number of left turns, thus reducing the time and gas that drivers waste idling at stoplights.</p>
<p>UPSs innovation is an example of how technology can help companies capture institutional knowledge about their customers. Before, when a truck loader or driver walked out the door, the package- loading techniques or route tips they'd developed over the years usually walked out with them. Now that knowledge is accessible in a central system. That eases the burden on substitute drivers and shortens the training time for new ones, lessening the chances of a lapse in customer service. There's no question the new system has enabled UPS to run its routes more efficiently. In November alone the company's drivers logged 3 million fewer miles than they did the year before."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The television show "Mythbusters" tested the theory of right-hand turns on one of their "MiniMyths" episodes and confirmed that even with more miles driven (as was the case in their test) making right hand turns  consumed less fuel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right turns not only increase efficiency by reducing fuel consumption, they also increase safety for the driver and other vehicles on the road,  because the driver no longer has to face oncoming traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#750a3c;font-family:Garamond;font-size:16pt;">On-board Computers<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As modern technology meets solid waste collection, numerous new items are becoming implemented in everyday collection practices.  One such valuable piece of equipment is the on-board computer.  Picture it as a GPS device on steroids.  Now, not only can the driver follow his route using the system, but the driver can also communicate with their offices for updates and notifications of route obstacles, or customers who do not have trash out.</p>
<p><span style="color:#003e75;font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:16pt;">Benefits to On-board Computers:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#8d9baf;font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:16pt;">Track Routes real time<br />
</span></p>
<ul style="margin-left:72pt;">
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;">Provides accountability by being able to locate where the collection vehicle is at all times.<br />
</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;">Eliminates doubt in driver efficiency.<br />
</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#8d9baf;font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:16pt;">Eliminate going back to pick up "Not Outs"<br />
</span></p>
<ul style="margin-left:72pt;">
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;">Provides a GPS time- and-date stamp in addition to messages from the driver that a customer did not have trash out.<br />
</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;">Depending on contract/requirements, may be enough to not require going back to collect from a customer who  did not have the trash out for the collection vehicle.<br />
</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#8d9baf;font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:16pt;">Turn-by-turn shows driver how to run the route properly<br />
</span></p>
<ul style="margin-left:72pt;">
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;">Ensures that the route is driven according to the sequence created for it.<br />
</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><span style="color:#8d9baf;font-size:16pt;">Relief Driver can run route without any prior knowledge of it</span><br />
</span></p>
<ul style="margin-left:72pt;">
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;">Drivers simply follow the GPS directions.<br />
</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#8d9baf;font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:16pt;">Integration with Billing Systems<br />
</span></p>
<ul style="margin-left:72pt;">
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Garamond;">With the drivers' ability to communicate with billing software, you can automatically charge the customer for extra bags or extra collection, thus not miss additional revenue.</span><span style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><br />
</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#8d9baf;font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:16pt;">All of these benefits increase driver efficiency<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#750a3c;font-family:Garamond;font-size:16pt;">Optimize Dump Trips<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most drivers head to the landfill to dump only when the vehicle is  completely full. Generally this is not the most efficient way to handle dump trips.  The route optimization software has a function to optimize dump trips.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a route requires two dumps, then these dumps should be scheduled for when the vehicle is closest to the transfer station/landfill.  By optimizing the dump trips, a driver can generally eliminate a trip or two per week for most routes.</p>
