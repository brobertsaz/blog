    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nHow often do you find that the awesome movie seats
    you have painstakingly chosen for yourself, is suddenly not available when you
    proceed to pay for it. \"Damn it! Just missed!\" you say. Wouldn't it be  great
    to be guaranteed the seat you selected everytime!\r\n\r\nThe problem with the
    above scenario (as is  with most e-commerce portals) is that, if two users almost simultaneously 
    select same seat and checkout to book, the seat will be booked with the user who
    has clicked first. The other user will be redirected to same page with message
    the S<em>eat has already been booked</em>. We all have used Indian Railway Website
    and this problem really gets me frustrated.So I wanted to build system in which
    the seat I select always gets booked.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, I came up
    with two solutions\r\n<h3>Auto Refresh every 2 seconds (like cricket scores on
    cricinfo.com)</h3>\r\n<ul>\n<li>This would increase load on server as there will
    be database query every 2 seconds and  again the load will increase with increase
    in concurrent users using the page.</li>\r\n\t<li>This would not create a real-time
    user experience.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Websockets</h3>\r\nWebSockets is a web technology
    providing full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection. It
    is similar to radio broadcasting. It consists of a broadcaster (radio transmitter)
    and subscribers (radio receivers). A user connects to a particular channel (frequency)
    and whatever is published over that channel is received by the user. Similarly,
    in the Websocket space, the broadcaster is a server and the subscriber is the
    browser.\r\n\r\nSo, in the earlier scenario, whenever a seats get booked, the
    server will broadcast message to all subscribers instantaneously. With the help
    of this message, wecan change the color of a booked seat immediately on all browsers
    that have the page open. This ensures\r\n<ul>\n<li>Low load on server.</li>\r\n\t<li>A
    Real Time user experience</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI thought of using <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><a
    title=\"websocket-rails\" href=\"https://github.com/DanKnox/websocket-rails\"
    target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">websocket-rails</span></a></span>
    gem as it makes it pretty easy to implement WebSocket in rails.  It is built over<span
    style=\"color:#000000;\"><a title=\"faye\" href=\"http://faye.jcoglan.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span
    style=\"color:#000000;\"> faye</span></a></span> (a publish-subscribe messaging
    system based on the Bayeux Protocol).\r\n<h2>Getting started with websocket-rails</h2>\r\n<h3>The
    Configuration</h3>\r\n<ol>\n<li>Add the websocket-rails gem to your Gemfile and
    run the bundle command</li>\r\n\t<li>Run the installation generator:   The generator
    will require the WebSocket javascripts  in our <code>application.js          
                                              </code>\r\n<pre>bundle exec rails g
    websocket_rails:install</pre>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nA lot more information related
    to setup is <a href=\"https://github.com/DanKnox/websocket-rails/wiki/Installation-and-Setup\">here</a>\r\n<h3>Connecting
    to the server</h3>\r\nYou connect to the server by creating a new WebSocketRails
    object and passing it the server address.\r\n\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]\r\n#
    app/views/bookings/index.html.haml\r\njavascript:\r\n  var dispatcher = new WebSocketRails('localhost:3001/websocket')\r\n[/code]\r\n<h3>Event
    Router and Trigger events on the server from the browser client</h3>\r\nThe installation
    generator will create the events.rb file in your config/initializers directory.
    All the routes related to websockets are to be added here. You can edit this file
    to begin mapping client side events to controller actions.\r\n\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]\r\n#
    config/initializers/events.rb\r\nsubscribe :hold_seat, to: UserController, with_method:
    :hold_seat\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nThis events triggered from the JavaScript client
    will invoke methods on the controller on the server. For example, from the browser
    JavaScript console, we can trigger the UsersController#hold_seat method with the
    following command\r\n\r\n[code language=\"javascript\"]\r\ndispatcher.trigger('hold_seat',
    {seat_number: 12});\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\n<strong>Triggering Events on the Client
    form server</strong>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Broadcasting to all connected clients</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou
    can trigger an event on the client using the broadcast_message method. The broadcast_message
    method takes two arguments, the event name to trigger(function to invoke on client
    side), and an object to send along with the event.\r\n\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]\r\n#
    app/controller/users_controller.rb:\r\nbroadcast_message :update_seat_status,
    {number: seat.number, state: 'hold'}\r\n[/code]\r\n<ul>\n<li> Broadcasting to
    subscribed clients</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe channel will be automatically created
    the first time a client subscribes to the channel or a message is broadcasted
    to the channel on the server.\r\n\r\nTo listen to events on channel we can add
    this JavaScript on our page\r\n\r\n[code language=\"javascript\"]\r\n# app/assets/javascripts/websocket.js\r\nchannel
    = dispatcher.subscribe(channel_name);\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nTo publish to a specific
    channel, we can publish a message to that channel from anywhere in a Rails application
    using the following code syntax:\r\n\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]\r\nWebsocketRails[:channel_name].trigger(:event_name,
    object_to_send)\r\n[/code]\r\n<ul>\n<li>Publishing events from the browser client</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[code
    language=\"javascript\"]\r\nchannel.trigger('event_name', object_to_send);\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nA
    full fledged working Rails application for booking seats using Websocket-rails
    is available on my <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><a title=\"github account\"
    href=\"https://github.com/pratik14/booking\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">github
    account</span></a></span>\r\n<h2>Caveats</h2>\r\n<ul>\n<li>I used passenger as
    application server and  as far passenger 3 is concerned it does not support  WebSockets.
    Passenger 4 does support websockets but I have not tried it yet. Instead, I used
    thin as a standalone server. In this situation only  the page which needs WebSocket
    connection was rendered using the standalone server and rest of the application
    works on passenger.  We also need to use Redis to enable publishing channel events
    to the standalone server.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Configuration
    to enable standalone server mode</p>\r\n\r\n[code language=\"ruby\"]\r\n# config/initializers/events.rb\r\nWebsocketRails.setup
    do |config|\r\n  config.standalone = true\r\nend\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nFor more configuration
    click <a href=\"https://github.com/DanKnox/websocket-rails/wiki/Standalone-Server-Mode\">here</a>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Use
    Thin server as primary app server.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Protocol Upgradation from
    http to websocket protocol</h3>\r\nIt is required to change the protocol form
    http to websockcet for creating websocket. Nginx did announce its support for
    protocol upgradation for websocket in its 1.3.13 version (Feb 2103).  We just
    to need configure nginx to change protocol  from http to websocket protocol for
    a specific route.  In below configuration protocol upgradation is done using  proxy_set_header
    option.\r\n\r\n[code language=\"bash\"]\r\nserver {\r\n  listen   80;\r\n  server_name
     app.local;\r\n  root  /home/app/public;\r\n  passenger_enabled on;\r\n  rails_env
    development;\r\n\r\n  location /any_location {\r\n     proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/realtime_page;\r\n
    \    proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n
    \    proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\r\n  }\r\n}[/code]</div>\";}"

<p>Great write up for Websockets and Nginx (and you should be using Nginx!!)</p>
