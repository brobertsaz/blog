    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nEver since I began my Ruby On Rails journey I
    have followed countless Rails tutorials on countless websites. Sometimes I learned
    a lot, sometimes I came away just as confused as I had been before. If I could
    do it all over again I would narrow it down to a few handful of websites that
    have helped me tremendously on my Rails journey.\r\n\r\nThe following websites/tutorials
    are in the order they should be completed.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html\"><strong>Getting
    Started with Rails</strong></a> - This should have been my first tutorial. Incredibly
    simple and helpful. Do not move on from this tutorial until you have memorized
    most of the code.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://guides.railsgirls.com/\">Rails
    Girls Guides</a></strong> - This is one site I plan on re-visiting. It has many
    short tutorials perfect for the beginner. When you're just beginning Rails, it's
    important to keep it simple. Keep to the basics. Open up your text editor and
    re-type code over and over until you start to memorize parts of it. Repetition
    helps with understanding how Rails works.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.railstutorial.org/\"><strong>Â Ruby
    On Rails Tutorial</strong></a> - The hardest tutorial on this list. I would not
    recommend this tutorial until you have finished the previous tutorials.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"https://www.baserails.com/\"><strong>BaseRails</strong></a> - This is by
    far the most helpful rails website I have found to date. So dang helpful with
    practical Rails applications that give you a sense of accomplishment. It's not
    free but it is absolutely worth the price. $25 dollars a month and worth every
    penny.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing these tutorials you should be ready to start building
    your own stuff.</div>\";}"
