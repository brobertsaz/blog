<p>UPDATE Today was Part 2 of Solid Waste Routing Tip of the Week.</p>
<p>I will soon be posting a <a class="zem_slink" title="Municipal solid waste" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste">solid waste</a> routing tip of the week.  These will be ideas or strategies for improving efficiency in solid <a class="zem_slink" title="Waste collection" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_collection">waste collection</a>.  I will also be offering my new paper "Solid Waste Routing" as a download.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me if you would like more information or to comment on my Route Optimization blog articles.</p>
