<p style="text-align:justify;">We recently had issues with a lot of our Rspec tests suddenly failing.  We were getting a Selenium Error that there was a Modal dialog present.  After a lot of wasted time troubleshooting, it was determined that FF v. 13 was causing the issue.  It appears that this was an issue last fall (<a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/792131">http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/792131</a>)  After following the recommendations from that forum article, we still had the modal dialog issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our fix was to revert to FF v. 12 until they get things fixed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Update: I also tested FF v. 14 and the same issue persists.</p>
