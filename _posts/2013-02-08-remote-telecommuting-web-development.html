<p>I know that I have bitched and complained about this before.  There have been many that have as well.  Companies and headhunters are always contacting me to move to some place I will never ever ever want to move to.  Ask them about <a class="zem_slink" title="Telecommuting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">telecommuting</a> and they say they do not do that.  So they continue to search.  Maybe they find somebody or maybe they just take the best they can find and not the ideal candidate.</p>
