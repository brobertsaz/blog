    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nAny thing on the net is vulnerable to attack.
    The threat can be at any layer: <strong>database</strong>,Â  <strong>web server</strong>
    or <strong>web application</strong>. Some of the common security threat are :
    <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</strong></span>,
    <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF, XSRF)</strong></span>,
    <strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Man in the Middle (MITM)</span></strong>,Â 
    <strong>SQL Injection (SQLI)</strong>,Â  <strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Mass
    Assignment &amp; Parameter Injection</span></strong> etc . There is nothing like
    complete protection. There is a proverb in hindi \"<strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">taala
    sarifon k liae hota hai...choron k liae nahi</span></strong>\" , means \"<span
    style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Lock on the door can prevent good peoples from
    entering the house not the thieves</strong></span>\". But at least the lock can
    make the thieve to struggle for entry and provide <span style=\"color:#003300;\"><strong>60%
    security</strong></span> to our house.\r\n\r\nRails framework, provide <strong><span
    style=\"color:#003300;\">70% inbuilt security</span></strong> if you use all its
    feature properly and adhere to its <a title=\"security in rails\" href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">security guideline</a> . Web Security is a wide field in itself.
    I will keep updating this blog as I keep exploring, new <strong><span style=\"color:#003300;\">security
    measure</span></strong> . Meanwhile If you want to explore it yourself, you can
    read the below resource :\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#003300;\"><strong>=&gt;</strong></span>

    1 : Protection against Mass Assignment attack.</span></strong>\r\n\r\nMany a time,
    you have used <span style=\"color:#003366;\">@user = params[:user]</span> in your
    code . This is a case of <strong>mass assignment</strong> i,e any thing coming
    in<span style=\"color:#003366;\"> params[:user]</span> will be assigned to object
    <span style=\"color:#003366;\">@user</span> and when you save the object all of
    them get saved into database. Now here a attacker come, will modify the form in
    firefox console and add another input field for user with <span style=\"color:#003366;\">:admin
    =&gt; true</span> , now when you do <span style=\"color:#003366;\">@user = params[:user]</span>
    and save the object , he will get admin privilege and can do any thing now onward.\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>So simple to break in ..right ??</strong></span>\r\n\r\nNot
    so easy with rails 3 and upper version. Now attributes are prevented from mass
    assignment by default. So you have to explicitly define the list of attributes
    which are eligible for mass assignment with <span style=\"color:#003366;\"><strong><code>attr_protected</code></strong></span>,
    or <strong><span style=\"color:#003366;\"><code>attr_accessible</code></span></strong>
    .\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color:#003366;\"><code>attr_accessible</code> :name,
    :age</span></strong> # it is white listing of attributes for mass assignment\r\n\r\nIt
    means only name and age can be mass assigned, if <span style=\"color:#003366;\">params[:user]</span>
    cantain any attributes say <span style=\"color:#003366;\">:admin =&gt; true</span>
    , it will throw error.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color:#003366;\"><code>attr_protected</code>
    :admin</span></strong> # it is blacklisting of attributes for mass assignment\r\n\r\nIt
    means any attribute other then :admin can be mass assigned.\r\n\r\nI suggest you
    to use <span style=\"color:#003366;\"><strong><code>attr_accessible</code></strong></span>
    approach. I feel it is more safe. say you add a new attribute<span style=\"color:#003366;\">
    salary</span> in the user table but forgot to modify your model, it will automatically
    become eligible for mass assignment with <span style=\"color:#003366;\"><strong><code>attr_protected</code></strong></span>
    approach, but with <strong><span style=\"color:#003366;\"><code>attr_accessible</code></span></strong>
    approach it will throw error. Now if you feel salary safe to be mass assigned,
    you can add it to <span style=\"color:#003366;\"><strong><code>attr_accessible</code></strong></span>
    list.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#003300;\"><strong>Defence 2 : protection
    against cross site scripting (XSS) .</strong></span>\r\n\r\nOh..! You havenâ\x80\x99t
    heard about <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>cross site scripting (XSS)</strong></span>
    ...Read it <a title=\"cross site scripting\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a> . In short, It is execution of script by attacker on
    your page which may stole cookies session or any other information or break your
    application.\r\n\r\nLet us see a simple example :\r\n\r\nlet you have a application
    in which <strong>person1</strong> , input a message for <strong>person2</strong>,
    which get stored in db,when <strong>person2</strong> open his account the message
    displayed on his page with the code <span style=\"color:#003366;\">&lt;%= @message
    %&gt;</span> . But <strong>person1</strong> is a bad Guy(remember, mom use to
    remind us - world is full of bad people) . He entered the message <span style=\"color:#003366;\">\"&lt;script&gt;alert('Iam
    virus, Iam in..I will break your code')&lt;/script&gt;\"</span> .\r\n\r\nWhen
    <strong>person2</strong> open his page, what he will see. He will see the message<span
    style=\"color:#003366;\"> \"&lt;script&gt;alert('Iam virus, Iam in..I will break
    your code')&lt;/script&gt;\"</span> . <strong>No harm occur. Person1 must be cursing
    Rails</strong>.<span style=\"color:#333300;\"><strong> With Rails3 any HTML character
    in input will automatically escaped</strong></span>, in older version you have
    to use h() explicitly i,e the input code is <span style=\"color:#003366;\">&lt;%=h
    text_field_tag \"message\" %&gt;</span> . More detail on escaping HTML is available
    <a title=\"escaping html in rails\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/698700/escaping-html-in-rails\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a> . So the ill conceived message of <strong>person1</strong>
    get passed to db in harmless form as <span style=\"color:#003366;\">\"&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('Iam
    virus, Iam in..I will break your code')&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\"</span> .\r\n\r\nNow
    say, <strong>person1</strong> is big crook and able to insert the message<span
    style=\"color:#003366;\"> \"&lt;script&gt;alert('Iam virus, Iam in..I will break
    your code')&lt;/script&gt;\"</span> in db. But <strong>person2</strong> is again
    not harmed, as not only input but <span style=\"color:#333300;\"><strong>Rails
    escape any HTML in the ruby code</strong></span>. But what if you do not want
    to escape the html tag in the message. You want the message to be displayed as
    such, because <strong>Person3</strong> is a nice person and he send a well decorated
    message <span style=\"color:#003366;\">\"Arun &lt;strong&gt;I Love You&lt;/strong&gt;\"</span>
    , in which <strong>I love you</strong> is highlighted . You want it to display
    as <span style=\"color:#003366;\">\"Arun<strong> I Love You</strong>\"</span>,
    rather than <span style=\"color:#003366;\">\"Arun &lt;strong&gt;I Love You&lt;/strong&gt;\"</span>
    . So you need to override the Rails default escaping behaviour. below will do
    that\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color:#003366;\">&lt;%=rawÂ  @message %&gt;</span></strong>\r\n\r\ngreat,
    person3 message look great, but what is this <strong>person1</strong> ill conceived
    message also get executed, you see the alert box below\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2209\"
    align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"611\"]<a href=\"http://bobspython.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/virus.png\"><img

    in attacking your application .<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong> using raw
    for rendering is risky...will you use that???</strong></span>...I don't think
    so . If you still want bolded <strong>I Love You</strong>, try other alternative
    than raw : <a title=\"sanitize\" href=\"http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper/sanitize\"
    target=\"_blank\">sanitize</a> .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color:#003300;\">Â Defence
    3 : Protection against CROSS SITE REQUEST FORGERY(CSRF) .</span></strong>\r\n\r\nA
    good example of <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>CSRF</strong></span> is
    available <a title=\"CSRF\" href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a> . The detail documentation of preventing CSRF attack
    is available <a title=\"CSRF protection guide\" href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a> . So it is more like attack through chat messages,
    email, images etc. This attack is mostly executed on Authenticated i,e logedIn
    users. Basically, the cross site scripting attack happen due to your trust on
    the website, which is not fulfilled while the Cross Site request forgery attack
    occur due to website trust on you. Website trust you with using it properly, identifying
    its purpose, content, flow etc. It do not expect you to click on the link like
    \"HOT babes\", \"Free tour package\", \"your own FB profile link with friend request
    from a sweet girl\" etc. If they are not part of the website on your earlier website,
    there is great chance that some one attempting CSRF attack.But we are INNOCENT
    people, we are oblivion of any such attack. Rails come to your rescue.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are using rails version 3 or above, you can see below within head tag of layout
    generated by default.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color:#003366;\">&lt;%= csrf_meta_tags
    %&gt;</span></strong>\r\n\r\nThis line will create a secret token for each user
    session. If you see the page source, you can see the below line generated by the
    above code.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#003366;\">&lt;meta content=\"sptmtpH+EZYnhrfwPplCQkATltqeHwaBAOJAgyj8CII=\"
    name=\"csrf-token\" /&gt;</span>\r\n\r\nThe above token value is stored in a hidden
    filed within each form. It look as below in one of my form for the current session.\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#003366;\">&lt;input type=\"hidden\" value=\"sptmtpH+EZYnhrfwPplCQkATltqeHwaBAOJAgyj8CII=\"
    name=\"authenticity_token\"&gt;</span>\r\n\r\nWhen, my session expire and I log
    in again, this token will change. attacker can never know this secret as it is
    generated on fly.<strong>So attacker can disguise you to submit a form which look
    like a form of your web application, but he can't bypass the authenticity token
    and rail will throw an error</strong>, saving us from the attack.\r\n\r\nYou can
    bypass the above default security measure of rails with below line of code, if
    you find any reason to do so.\r\n<pre class=\"highlight ruby\"><strong><span class=\"s2\"
    style=\"color:#003366;\">Â skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token</span></strong></pre>\r\nBut
    it is like \"<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Going to war without a shield</span>\"
    .will you do that...??.. NO...I know you are mature enough.\r\n\r\nAlso, <span
    style=\"color:#003300;\"><strong>always submit form with post method</strong></span>.
    Get method is too easy to attack. Post is also not fool proof, but is harder to
    attack.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#003366;\">match \"/launch_all_the_missiles\"
    =&gt; \"missiles#launch_all\", :method =&gt; :get</span>\r\n\r\nlook crazy...look
    like any one can destroy the world. post provide better protection against attack.
    If you want such route in your application write it as post method\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#003366;\">match \"/launch_all_the_missiles\" =&gt; \"missiles#launch_all\",
    :method =&gt; :post</span>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#003300;\"><strong>Defence
    4 : protection against Packet Sniffing (MITM).</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span
    style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Packet Sniffing</span></strong> is also known as <span
    style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>Man IN The Middle</strong></span> attack. It
    is same as, you written all your secret in a letter , posted it to your lover,
    but postman read it before delivering. There are many software like <a title=\"fireship\"
    href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep\" target=\"_blank\">FireShip</a>
    , whichÂ  can track the bits crossing the wire, and if the data is in plain text..your
    game is over. Isn't good to write the letter in encrypted word before posting,
    the postman would not have know the secret even if he manage to open the letter.
    Rails do that encryption for you if you set below configuration in your environment
    file.\r\n<div class=\"line number1 index0 alt2\"><span style=\"color:#003366;\"><strong><code
    class=\"ruby plain\">config.force_ssl = </code><code class=\"ruby keyword\">true</code></strong></span></div>\r\n<div
    class=\"line number1 index0 alt2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"line number1 index0
    alt2\">\n<strong>It will Force all access to the app over SSL, use Strict-Transport-Security,
    and use secure cookies. Now data will be send in encrypted form</strong>.</div>\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#003300;\"><strong>Defence 5: protection against SQL injection</strong></span>\r\nThis
    is one of the most common and abused attack on any web application, and involve
    hijacking sql command. let us take a example of a banking application, which allow
    a loged in user to see all the loan he has applied for. When a user click on any
    of the listed loan, your application show the details of that loan. Let the user
    is genuine one, who do not alter the params. let <span style=\"color:#003366;\">params[loan_id]
    = \"23239\"</span>\r\n\r\nBeing a Rails developer, you may use where clause of
    Active::Record to retrieve the detail. But, you can construct a where clause in
    three ways as below.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color:#800000;\">1.9.3-p194
    :021 &gt; @loan = Loan.where(\"loan_id = ? \" ,params[:loan_id])</span></strong>\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Loan Load (0.1ms)Â  SELECT `loans`.* FROM `loans`
    WHERE (loan_id = '23239' )</strong></span>\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">
    =&gt; [#&lt;Loan id: 376, user_id: 41, loan_number: \"100150\", status: \"Declined\",
    app_name: \"Pisa Productions\", app_date: \"2014-11-24 08:00:00\", relationship_manager:

    nil, loan_amt: 100000, business_type: nil, finance_rate: nil, payment_amt: nil,
    years_in_business: nil, terms: nil, created_at: \"2014-01-02 11:06:08\", updated_at:
    \"2014-01-02 11:06:08\", sales_force_application_id: \"006d000000Gj5n5AAB\", loan_id:

    \"23239\", dealership_name: \"Pisa Productions\"&gt;]</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#800000;\"><strong>1.9.3-p194
    :022 &gt; @loan = Loan.where(\"loan_id = '#{params[:loan_id]}' \")</strong></span>\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Loan Load (0.2ms)Â  SELECT `loans`.* FROM `loans`
    WHERE (loan_id = '23239' )</strong></span>\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">

    \"23239\", dealership_name: \"Pisa Productions\"&gt;]</span>\r\n\r\nSo, the sql
    query generated by Active::Record for the different syntax of where clause is
    same. <strong>But under the hood, the third form of where clause is vulnerable
    to sql attack but not the first two</strong>. Now say the bad guy enter, and he
    want to know the loan detail of any other person. He will just change the params[:loan
    id] to make a sql attack. This will do the trick for him.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#003366;\"><strong>params[:loan_id]
    = \"' OR 1=1--'\"</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<strong>The above is a sql injection
    code, you can easily see that, it will always return true as even if all other
    condition return false 1=1 will definitely going to return true true making the
    OR to return true at the end.</strong>\r\n\r\nAgain run the above in console.
    You will get below result.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#800000;\"><strong>1.9.3-p194
    :024 &gt; @loan = Loan.where(:loan_id =&gt; params[:loan_id])</strong></span>\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Loan Load (0.3ms)Â  SELECT `loans`.* FROM `loans`
    WHERE `loans`.`loan_id` = '' OR 1=1--''</strong></span>\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">
    =&gt; []</span>\r\n<span style=\"color:#800000;\"><strong>1.9.3-p194 :025 &gt;

    WHERE (loan_id = '' OR 1=1--'' )</strong></span>\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">

    @loan = Loan.where(\"loan_id = '#{params[:loan_id]}' \")</strong></span>\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#ff6600;\"><strong>Loan Load (0.3ms)Â  SELECT `loans`.* FROM `loans`
    WHERE (loan_id = '' OR 1=1--'' )</strong></span>\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">
    =&gt;Â  =&gt; [#&lt;Loan id: 376, user_id: 41, loan_number: \"100150\", status:

    loan_id: \"23239\", dealership_name: \"Pisa Productions\"&gt;,</span>\r\n<span
    style=\"color:#ff6600;\"> ..all othe records]</span>\r\n\r\nSo you can see that,
    the first two syntax escape the special character while generating the sql query,
    thus preventing from sql injection but the last one do not.\r\n\r\nAlways, be
    careful while writing your where clause.\r\n\r\nTake another example, this is
    serious one, with your negligence any one can bypass your authentication system.
    You are stubborn to my advice and goes with your old way of writing the where
    clause.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#003366;\"><strong>User.where(\"email = '#{params[:email]}'
    AND encrypted_password = '#{params[:password]}'\")</strong></span>\r\n\r\nOn your
    login page the user just need to enter<span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>
    ' OR 1=1--'</strong></span> in both email and password field, and he will be loged
    in.\r\n\r\nBut Rails also not provide full protection against SQL injection, may
    be they get corrected in upcoming version, but currently, like where, if you not
