<p>OK, everybody, it is time for us to give back to the Ruby/Rails community that has made many of us a enjoyable and profitable life....</p>
<p>We at Socialwhirled have decided to sponsor and host a <strong>RailsBridge</strong> event in Phoenix (<a href="http://railsbridge.org/">http://railsbridge.org/</a>) the 19th and 20th of September.</p>
<p><strong>From their site:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We teach people to code because we believe that the people making technology should accurately reflect the diversity of those using it.</p>
<p>We want to push for all kinds of diversity in tech: gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, and class. Women were the first population we focused on, but aren't the last.</p>
<p>We value acceptance, enthusiasm, and hard work. The <strong>RailsBridge</strong> community thrives on optimism and a love for making great things.</p>
<p>What's a RailsBridge Workshop<strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Our most well-known efforts are free weekend workshops where women learn Ruby on Rails from volunteers. The students at our workshops range from folks who are completely new to programming to QA engineers and professional developers who want to learn Rails. During the Installfest (usually on a Friday evening), we get students' laptops setup with the requisite technologies. The next day, we break into small group based on experience level and build a web app! (When we aren't teaching Ruby and Rails, we teach HTML &amp; CSS.)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Here is what we need:</strong></p>
<p>Volunteers to assist in teaching as well as TA'ing.  I think we will need about 8 people that can teach a class using their curriculum and assistants to help attendees that are stuck.</p>
<p>Attendees to attend.  Spread the word to friends, strangers, social media, etc...</p>
<p>I will post the links as soon as I have them setup.  All social media should use the #railsbridge and #railsbridgeaz hashtags.</p>
<p>Most of us learned form others so lets return the favor.</p>
<p>Questions, comments, suggestions, want to volunteer, email me at <a href="mailto:broberts@socialwhirled.com">broberts@socialwhirled.com</a></p>
