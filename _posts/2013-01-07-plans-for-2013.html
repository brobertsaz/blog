<p style="text-align:justify;">Well another year has gone by.  Time now for all of our plans that we sillily (I guess that is a rela word) call resolutions!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Last year was big for me.  First I was made partner with RebelHold, and then created my own Rebel Outpost, LLC.  I had two successful interns which are still working with us.  I spent the majority of the year working on a behemoth project called Bulletin Builder for the Greek Orthodox church.  I finally passed the reins for Bulletin Builder off to Steve Young to see to completion.  I worked on another short project as well as some in house open source stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://railscrm.com">RailsCRM</a> is still in the works with a recent Alpha release.  I am trying to add some more functionality to it without bloating it.  We are using it full time now for internal leads and finding a few changes needed here and there.  I have even been thinking about forking it and going full blown with it to offer SaaS to compete with the likes of Salesforce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have additionally been working on perfecting a script to create the perfect Rails production server.  I started to use Vagrant for testing my server setup.  I wish the world survived just on Heroku but it unfortunately does not.  So for the rest I am trying to come up with a better way to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">OK, so 2013.  I have big plans for Rebel Outpost this year.  I hope to make it a breeding zone for Rails developers as plan on taking on more interns.  I also have been talking to a friend about some more serious Rails incubation.  I find myself with a bit more time at the beginning of the year and have focused on getting all caught up and ready for tax time.  Now, I should have the time to finally get going with my "Rails, now what?" screencasts that I have been talking about since last year.  I intend to be a bigger part in the local Rails community and hope to get others to join me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I want to continue to work on free and open source applications and might even think about building some kind of money making application as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that is it.  Open source, teaching interns, and making Rebel Outpost a kick ass place to work.</p>
