    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\n<h3>What is Ruby On Rails?</h3>\r\nRuby is a programming
    language. Hardcore code - the stuff that's impossible to understand for an untrained
    person. You can do stuff with this language; anything, really. You can program
    stuff, write software with it etc.\r\n\r\nRails is bit like a piece of software
    you use to <!--more-->program stuff. It uses Ruby. People use it because it makes
    things a lot easier. When you build something with it, it makes things a lot easier,
    because it does a lot of the programming and all kinds of other stuff for you,
    in the background.\r\n\r\nSo, although it's useful to know some Ruby, the main
    battle is learning how to use Rails, or 'Ruby <em>on</em> Rails'.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you program in Ruby, you write text files in the Ruby language. Rails then interprets
    that language and does stuff with it.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like when you speak. You
    speak in English, for example, to someone else, and their brain, being equipped
    with the ability to understand English, interprets the sound you produce and carries
    out your orders. You are writing in Ruby, and Rails is interpreting that text
    and carrying your orders.\r\n\r\nRails can also understand other languages, too.\r\n<h3>What
    is Sublime Text?</h3>\r\nSublime Text is a text editor (Windows Notepad is a text
    editor, too!). However, it's a text editor made for programmers so, handily, it
    shows all the relevant folders you're using at the side, so you can get to them
    quickly and the files therein. Also, when displaying your text files, it colours
    the text in different colours, making it easier to read the code.\r\n\r\nYou use
    Sublime Text to create and edit the text files that Rails uses to do stuff.\r\n<h3>What
    is the \"Terminal\"?</h3>\r\nThe terminal is a piece of voodoo. But it only seems
    that way because you're not used to it. What you <em>are</em> used to is <em>also</em>
    a piece of voodoo, you just don't think it is, because you've been using it for
    years. You just accept it, rather than think about how it's working too much.
    This is what you have to do with the terminal. Don't question it too much.\r\n\r\nThe
    terminal is a way to <em>textually</em> interact with your computer, instead of
    using your mouse for everything.\r\n\r\nWhy is it used? Well, actually, once you've
    used it quite a lot, you'll see that it's actually <em>better</em> <em>and easier</em>
    for doing the stuff you need to do when you're using Ruby On Rails. Once you're
    reasonably fluent with it, you won't want a point-and-click interface for when
    you're warrioring around.\r\n\r\n\"warrior around\" - phrasal verb: to work on
    a Ruby On Rails application.\r\n<h3>What is a Web Application / Web App?</h3>\r\nThis
    one's a bit annoying - people say it and never think to explain what it means.\r\n\r\nA
    web <em>page</em> doesn't really <em>do</em> anything - you read it and look at
    it. If it's a website that does something, you <em>could</em> call it a web app.\r\n\r\nSee,
    you don't need Ruby On Rails to make a web page, but it's one of the things you
    can use to make a web app i.e. a website that does something. Facebook is a web
    app, so is flickr, twitter, your blog.\r\n\r\nIf it's just a page that you can
    look at, but can't interact with in any way, it's a web page. If it's something
    you can log into and/or do something with, it's a web app / web application.</div>\";}"

<p>My favorite quote:<br />
"The terminal is a piece of voodoo"<br />
I totally felt that way the first time in a console!!</p>
