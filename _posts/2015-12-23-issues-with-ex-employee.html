<p>So here is a question for all of you out there. You recently had to let go an employee due to cutbacks. This employee was chosen to be let go due to bad work ethics and bad attitude when others were able to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>Since then this ex-employee has been harassing your company by signing up with fake users and with harassing statements made on the companies platform live chat. Now none of these are "illegal activities" per se but nevertheless childish and immature.  I mean, I am not sure if it is illegal.  What defines harassment when it comes to the web these days?  Maybe it is illegal and legal action could and maybe should be taken.</p>
<p>What do you think the proper thing to do would be.  It goes without saying that I am sure that you would not give them a good reference every, but what else?  What would you do?</p>
