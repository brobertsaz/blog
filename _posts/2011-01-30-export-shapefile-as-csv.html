<p><span style="color:#555555;font-size:12pt;">I recently had issues with a simple export to .csv.  What I wanted to do is pull in a shapefile and delete a bunch of fields and then export it out to a .csv (this works the same for saving to a text file).  It actually turned out easier than I thought as I did not need to delete all the fields but rather I just wrote out the fields that I wanted to keep:<br />
</span></p>
<p>[sourcecode language="Python"]</p>
<p># Import system modules<br />
import sys, string, os, glob, csv<br />
import arcgisscripting<br />
# Create the Geoprocessor object<br />
gp = arcgisscripting.create()</p>
<p># System arguments<br />
input = sys.argv[1]<br />
output = sys.argv[2]</p>
<p># Set our new outputnew to be opened output with write privileges.<br />
outputnew=open(output,'wb')</p>
<p># Set linewriter as csv.writer written out to outputnew<br />
# The delimiter can be set as comma, pipe etc.<br />
linewriter=csv.writer(outputnew, delimiter=',')</p>
<p># If you want to pass all fields thru then disregard this.  I use this as I only want to pass some of the fields out and these are listed in Python list<br />
good_fields = ['field 1', 'field 2', 'field 3', 'field 4', 'field 5']</p>
<p># Now we go thru all of the fields and keep just those that are in the list of good fields<br />
flds=gp.ListFields(stops_in)<br />
fld = flds.Next()<br />
header=[]<br />
while fld:<br />
    if fld.Name in good_fields:<br />
        value=fld.Name<br />
        header.append(value)<br />
    fld = flds.Next()<br />
linewriter.writerow(header)</p>
<p># And we run thru each row populating the kept fields<br />
row=cursor.Next()<br />
row_num = 1<br />
while row:<br />
    line=[]<br />
    if row_is_valid(row_num, row):<br />
        for fld in header:<br />
            value=row.GetValue(fld)<br />
            line.append(value)<br />
        linewriter.writerow(line)<br />
    row=cursor.Next()<br />
    row_num += 1</p>
<p>del cursor<br />
gp.AddMessage(&quot;Finished&quot;)<br />
output.close()</p>
<p>[/sourcecode]</p>
<p><span style="color:#555555;font-size:12pt;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#555555;font-size:12pt;">I originally attempted to make a copy of the original shapefile and then a table view from the shapefile. In the end all I needed to do was simply read the input shapefile and then write it out to the .csv file.</span></p>
