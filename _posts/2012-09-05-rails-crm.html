<p style="text-align:justify;">An ongoing pet project of mine has been <a href="http://railscrm.com" target="_blank">Rails CRM</a> which is a CRM (<a class="zem_slink" title="CRM and Sales Software" href="http://www.business.com/software/crm-and-sales-software/" rel="businesscom" target="_blank">Customer Relations Management</a>) built on Rails and using <a class="zem_slink" title="MongoDB" href="http://www.mongodb.org/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Mongodb</a> for the database.  This was also a practice project for my last intern Ricky.  This all came about when we were trying to find an <a class="zem_slink" title="Open Source" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Open_Source" rel="wikinvest" target="_blank">open-sourced</a> CRM for RebelHold to use.  There are a few out there but none using our preferred and probably the best database, Mongodb.  Many also had a lot of shall I say baggage.  I was looking for a more or less basic CRM to customize and finally came to the conclusion that I would need to make a new one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Well recently I spent quite a bit of time cleaning up the <a class="zem_slink" title="RSpec" href="http://rspec.info/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Rspec</a> tests and the Twitter Bootstrap layout.  It is by no means ready for primetime but we are really close.  Most of the basic functionality is there but I am planning on adding some more bells and whistles.  After that, I am going to leave it alone and use a clone of it to further customize for our use.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can find more information on the <a href="http://railscrm.com" target="_blank">Rails CRM</a> homepage or can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/brobertsaz/rails_mongo_crm" target="_blank">Github</a>.  Please feel free to email me ideas/suggestions/bitches and/or complaints.  I will update when the project is fully completed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Update: You can now go to railscrm.com or to check out the demo, go to demo.railscrm.com.</p>
