    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\n<h3>Preface</h3>\r\nEveryone agrees that writing
    clean ruby code is essential. There are many blog posts about refactoring your
    ruby code to make it more readable and maintainable. As tests become a major part
    of our programming routine, I feel there is a large place for improvement in the
    way we write and maintain our test-suites. Many ruby projects consist of more
    rspec lines than actual ruby code, and that requires us to treat our test code
    with as much care as we treat our actual ruby code, if not even more. Writing
    specs may be considered by programmers as a burden or a chore if not done the
    right way. That may cause some programmers to write less specs for their code
    or to even totally give up on it. Luckily, RSpec provides us with all the tools
    necessary to create efficient, great looking and fun-to-write specs for our code.
    I'd like to go over a process of refactoring a test-suite written in RSpec for
    a small library I've recently written in FTBpro.com.\r\n<h3>The Domain</h3>\r\nIn
    <a href=\"http://www.ftbpro.com\">FTBPro</a> we have posts written by users, and
    a dynamic set of reaction templates that allows the user to react to that post.
    A post has a locale and a type, reaction templates has a locale and an array of
    types which they fit to. When a new post is created, we want to attach the most
    suitable reaction template to it:\r\n<ol>\n<li>It must have the same locale as
    the post.</li>\r\n\t<li>Its types array must include the post's type.</li>\r\n\t<li>From
    the set of matching reaction templates by rules 1 and 2, choose the one which
    was created the latest.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI came out with the following interface
    to do this job:\r\n<code>FindReaction.for(post).attach</code>\r\nWhile\r\n<code>FindReaction.for(post).reaction\r\n</code>holds
    the reaction which was found - I mainly exposed this for tests purposes.\r\n\r\nNow
    the funny part about this blog post is that I'm not going to post here the code
    which implemented this logic, we shouldn't even care about it. What I'm going
    to do is to present you with a messed up test suite for this logic, and lead you
    through the process of making it a blast.\r\n\r\nThis test suit contains 4 simple
    specs which describe the behavior we expect from FindReaction:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/erez-rabih/6697511\r\n\r\nAlthough
    these specs pass they're not optimal. Let's follow these rules of thumb to make
    this spec a blast!\r\n<h4>Rule #1: Keep your specs DRY - use before blocks</h4>\r\nThe
    first line of each spec is identical - we create a post. It should be extracted
    to a before block so we don't have to mention it over and over again.\r\n<h4>Rule
    #2: Use before :all instead of before :each when possible</h4>\r\nWhy should we
    create the post before each spec runs? If you're not changing your model's attributes
    between specs, you should definitely use before :all.\r\nA note on this: unlike
    before :each blocks which are wrapped in a DB transaction and thus getting rollbacked
    after the spec is executed, before :all blocks have to be cleaned explicitly so
    that you don't fill your test DB with garbage.\r\n<h4>Rule #3: Use build instead
    of create when possible</h4>\r\nWe're using FactoryGirl to create a post. Creating
    is an expensive operation: The post has to go through validations, we save it
    to the DB and in many cases it requires other models to be created as well. For
    example, if part of a post validation says it has to have a user than we'll create
    a user as well. By building a post instead of creating we save all this time and
    get the same outcome.\r\n<h4>Rule #4: Use describe to create nested specs groups.
    describe should relate to an operation or an object.</h4>\r\nWe're actually testing
    here 2 different methods of FindReaction. Specs 1-3 describe the reaction method
    while spec #4 describes the attach method. Each of these methods should have its
    own describe block.\r\n<h4>Rule #5: Use variables instead of constants to keep
    your specs from becoming too fragile.</h4>\r\nIn lines 19-21 we create reaction
    templates and we want their locale to match the created post's locale. Instead
    of using the string \"en\" again and again we should use post.locale\r\nThis makes
    your spec less fragile so that if someday someone changes the post's locale, he
    won't have to change the reaction templates creation as well.\r\n<h4>Rule #6:
    Use RSpec's magnificent be_ syntactic sugar</h4>\r\nRSpec has many syntactic sugars
    that makes your specs more readable. Let's look at line 6 for example:\r\n<code>reaction.blank?.should
    == true</code>\r\nWhen an object reacts to some_method_name? RSpec allows you
    to write the test in the following way:\r\n<code>object.should be_some_method_name</code>\r\nOr
    in our case:\r\n<code>reaction.should be_blank</code>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<h4>Rule
    #7: Use create! and save! instead of create and save</h4>\r\nWhen creating or
    saving models to your DB, use create! and save! instead of create and save.\r\nThe
    difference is that the bang version of the methods throws an exception if the
    operation fails, while the non-banged versions just return false. I wasted a lot
    of time debugging failed specs only to find out the model was not saved or created
    due to validation or another problem. By using create! and save! you'll be sure
    that the model was created successfully and it exists for you to test it, otherwise
    an exception will be thrown and you'll know about it immediately.\r\n<h3>Midway</h3>\r\nAfter
    applying these  7 simple rules our spec following already looks much better:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/erez-rabih/6698414\r\nYou
    might think to yourself \"OK, this looks great\", but I've got a surprise for
    you: The interesting part is only ahead of us. Let's take the extra leap to improve
    our specs even more.\r\n<h4>Rule #8: If/When rule of thumb</h4>\r\nWhen there
    is a \"if\" or \"when\" in your it \"should ...\" clause, there's a hidden context
    in it.\r\nLooking at spec #2 our it clause looks like this:\r\n<code>it \"should
    return no reaction template if reaction templates exist, but non fitting\"</code>\r\nThere's
    an <strong>if</strong> in it, and that's exactly what we're looking for. If or
    when mean you're describing a state. These states should be extracted to a context
    block with a before block describing the state. After applying this rule spec
    #2 should look like this:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/erez-rabih/6698523\r\n\r\nWe
    should apply the same to specs 1,3 and 4\r\n<h4>Rule #9: Use subject/it clauses
    to keep your specs DRY'er and cleaner</h4>\r\nWe can easily identify that specs
    1,2 and 3 all test the same result: <code>FindReaction.for(@post).reaction</code>\r\nThis
    can be easily extracted into <code>subject {FindReaction.for(@post).reaction}
    </code>phrase which does miracles to our test code.\r\n<h4>Rule #10: One assertion
    per test case</h4>\r\nI like to have only one assertion in each spec. This way
    if the spec fails, you immediately know what went wrong and don't even have to
    look at the detailed output of the failure. It also keeps your specs clean and
    focused on what they're supposed to test. Spec #3 has two assertions in it, in
    the first we check that a reaction is found and in the second we check what specific
    reaction was found. These are two completely different assertions and deserve
    different specs. The one assertion per spec rule is easily achieved with combination
    of Rule #9, we'll see why right away.\r\n<h4>Rule #11: Use RSpec's expect {} block
    to describe a change in the state of an object</h4>\r\nIn spec #4 we test that
    the post's reaction_template has changed from nil to the attached reaction. RSpec
    has a nice and clean way to describe these kind of state changes:\r\n<code>expect
    { some_operation }.to change{something}.from(initial_value).to(final_value)</code>\r\nIt
    is much cleaner and more readable this way.\r\n\r\nThis is the result after applying
    rules #8-#11 to our spec:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/erez-rabih/6698783\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nSo
    what have we earned in this refactoring process? I'll point the main advantages
    of the new code:\r\n<ol>\n<li>Our test-suite runs faster</li>\r\n\t<li>Our test
    file is more readable</li>\r\n\t<li>The failure output provided by RSpec is better</li>\r\n\t<li>We're
    not repeating ourselves between specs</li>\r\n\t<li>It is extremely easy to extend
    the specs to describe new features</li>\r\n\t<li>I find it much more enjoyable
    writing specs that looks cool (And you must admit, it does look cool).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI
    know that even this code can be optimized and refactored, but I had to stop somewhere
    :)\r\nI'll be glad to hear your insights and thoughts.\r\n\r\n* This post was
