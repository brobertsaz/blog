<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, we added Steve Young (@jediunixmaster) as a partner to the <a href="http://rebel-outpost.com">Rebel Outpost, LLC</a>.  Steve has been working his tail off since joining us in the beginning of the year.  Always eager to please and a workaholic by nature, Steve never slows down and he does not quit until the job is done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His many years of programming experience combined with his business management skills will definitely be a valuable asset to Rebel Outpost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been an exciting week this week with a new partner and a new intern!!!  Go Rebel Outpost!!</p>
