<p>Lately we have been incorporating <a href="https://github.com/argerim/select2-rails">select2-rails</a> into our applications.  I cannot say enough how much I love this tool and its ease of use.</p>
<p>That being said, we had had issues with testing and select2-rails.  So Steve Tong of Rebel-Outpost spent some time and found a small script to use for testing it.</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/4339329</p>
<p>The only issue with this is that you can only have one option in the select2.</p>
<p>If anybody finds a better way, please let us know.</p>
