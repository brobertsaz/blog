    style=\"color:#000000;\">)</span></em></h3>\r\n<strong>Ruby, predominately</strong>Â known
    as an object-oriented programming language, shows up frequently on lists of the
    top ten (or whatever) languages to know. And Ruby has long been paired with Rails
    to create the popular <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a
    href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\"><span style=\"color:#800000;text-decoration:underline;\">Ruby
    on Rails</span></a></span></span> web application framework.\r\n\r\nWhen the forerunner
    of this book appeared eight years ago, it was titled <em>Ruby for Rails: Ruby
    Techniques for Rails Developers</em>. And R4R, as it is sometimes known, was well
    received in both the Ruby and Rails camps.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the R4R book was revised
    and retitled <em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em>. \"This new edition is Â a descendant
    of R4R but not exactly an update. Itâ\x80\x99s more ofÂ a repurposing,\" the author,
    David A. Black, noted at the time. \"<em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em> is a 'just
    Ruby' book, and itâ\x80\x99s written to be read by anyoneÂ interested in Ruby.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>That
    focus</strong>Â continues in this second edition, which has been updated to cover
    Ruby 2.1. Ruby newcomers can get startedÂ and advance quickly with this fine \"just
    Ruby\" book in hand. Ruby veterans also can use it to gain new knowledge and sharpen
    familiar skills.\r\n\r\nBlack approaches the process of explaining Ruby \"as a
    kind of widening spiral, building on the familiar but always opening out into
    the unknown.\"\r\n\r\nHis well-written text does not try to be a \"complete\"
    language reference. Instead, reading <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span
    style=\"color:#800000;\"><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1oCshVV\"><span style=\"color:#800000;text-decoration:underline;\">The
    Well-Grounded Rubyist</span></a></span></span></em> is like having a well-experienced
    and patient mentor close at hand--a mentor who willingly offers up clear examples
    and explanations. You likely will want to keep this book around as a go-to how-to
    reference long after you have learned and begun to work with Ruby.\r\n\r\n<strong>It
    does help</strong> to have at least a little experience with programming before
    you tackle Ruby and this book. And, if you already have an older version of Ruby
    installed on your computer, upgrade it to 2.1.x. (As this review is being written,
    2.1.2 is the current version.)\r\n\r\nYes, Ruby can be usedÂ in several different
    programming paradigms, including functional and imperative. But <em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span
    style=\"color:#800000;\"><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1oCshVV\"><span style=\"color:#800000;text-decoration:underline;\">The
    Well-Grounded Rubyist</span></a></span></span></em> is essentially all-object-oriented-all-the-time
    in its approach.\r\n\r\n\"Ruby is an object-oriented language, and the sooner
    you dive into howÂ Ruby handles objects, the better,\" Black states. \"Accordingly,
    objects will serve both as a way toÂ bootstrap the discussion of the language
    (and your knowledge of it) and as aÂ golden thread leading us to further topics
    and techniques.\"\r\n<h4>-- <em><span style=\"color:#800000;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidunn\"><span
