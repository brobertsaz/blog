<p>A while back I created Rails CRM.  It was always meant to be a bare bones <a class="zem_slink" title="Customer relationship management" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Customer Relations Management</a> application as I did not find any that I liked.</p>
<p>I just released a beta version of Rails CRM - Advanced.  It is still pretty bare bones but we have added a few new features and a new look as well.  I am thinking of maybe providing a hosted solution for the new Rails CRM but I am not sure if there is any interest.</p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to check it out at <a href="http://www.railscrm.com">Rails CRM</a></p>
<p>As usual, this is open sourced and there are links to the Github repos on the front page.</p>
