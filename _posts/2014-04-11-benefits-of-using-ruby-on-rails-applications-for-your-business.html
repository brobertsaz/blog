    data-rehosted=\"1\"></a></strong><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, also known as
    Rails is an Open source Web application framework that uses Ruby programming language
    which allows creating and developing pages with higher efficiency, more flexibility,
    moreover less time consuming.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ruby on
    Rails has become one of the most popular and emerging programming language used
    for <strong>Web Application Development</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">There
    are plethora of other programming languages available that can be used for creating
    web applications and CMS (Content Management System) like PHP, JAVA, ASP, Python,
    Perl, etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">But Ruby on Rails stands out
    when it comes to <strong>Flexibility, Time, Cost, Security and Agility</strong></p>\r\n<p
    style=\"text-align:justify;\">Well, here are some of the considerable reasons
    why to choose Ruby on Rails over other <strong>Web Application Frameworks</strong></p>\r\n<p
    style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Development Speed</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ruby
    on Rails allows features to be developed quickly by freeing programmers from repetitive
    coding. It emphasizes convention over configuration since it adopts agile development
    concepts. This allows <strong><a href=\"http://railscarma.com/\">Ruby on Rails
    Development Company</a></strong> to move quickly from concept to estimating to
    actual development. This has significant benefits for larger projects that can
    be split up into smaller sized parts as well as entrepreneurs developing new products
    or web based ventures.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>\r\n<p
    style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ruby on Rails offer developers the ability to easily
    modify a web application in response to customer’s requirements with less time
    spent when compared to other programming languages. This allows improvements to
    be made and new features added to result in greater ability in keeping with changing
    business needs.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Reduced
    Development Cost</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Over and above
    the flexibility as well as development speed, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> is
    an open source technology. Through the use of a freely available platform, you
    can easily <strong>reduce costs</strong> without sacrificing performance, speed
    or security. Developing with RoR means development cost can be drastically cheaper
    than if the same project was created in heavier, less flexible, proprietary software
    (Non open source technologies), like Java or Dot Net.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Thriving
    Community </strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">An additional benefit
    of open source software is that the Ruby development community is highly active
    and responsive. This attribute is usually overlooked but translates into the strength
    of the technology and constantly drives it forward through enhancements, extensions
    as well as new documentation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Agile</strong></p>\r\n<p
    style=\"text-align:justify;\">RoR is the technology which goes hand in hand with
    agile methodology. <strong><a href=\"http://railscarma.com/\">Rails development</a></strong>
    cycles remain short, helping to facilitate the application of agile methodologies.
    Programmers use Test Driven Development to obtain desired results hence RoR is
    a good choice for your Agile and Scrum projects.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Creating
    a Complex Website</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Building a
    website may well be the most common instance in which you would probably utilize
    RoR. However, you could also use PHP. Why use one over the other? The argument
    goes like this: if you are just adding simple functionality to a simple, uncomplicated
    website, then use PHP. However, if you are creating a complex website or app that
    requires a database then you’ll want to use Rails.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Future
    Demand</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It should come as no real
    surprise why entrepreneurs as well as businesses have chosen <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>
    to create their web application.</p>\r\nSome of the most popular and well known
    web services that run on <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>:\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">1.
    Twitter</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">2. Groupon</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">3.
    LivingSocial</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">4. Hulu</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">5.
    SoundCloud</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">6. ZenDesk</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">7.
    GitHub</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">8. Shopify</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">9.
    SlideShare</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">10. Scribd</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finding
    or Hiring a <strong><a href=\"http://railscarma.com/hire-ruby-on-rails-developer.html\">Rails
    Developer</a></strong> or a Ruby on Rails Development Company for that matter,
    is of utmost importance when it comes to quality, efficiency of the work done
    and timely delivery of the project.</p>\n</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"

<p>Nice write up even if it is self serving advertisement.  I was not aware that Hulu is on Rails.</p>
