<p style="text-align:justify;">So I am torn with what to do with <a href="http://railscrm.com">RailsCRM</a>.  From the beginning it was always intended to be OSS and minimal.  Then I started to add on to it.  I feel that it should be something easy to use and require minimal setup and not have all of the bells and whistles as those could be added by the user.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I really do not know if anybody has used it for themselves as I have no idea whether anybody has cloned the repo and done anything with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, I thought lately that I will set it up as a <a class="zem_slink" title="Software as a Service" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Software_as_a_Service" target="_blank" rel="wikinvest">SaaS</a> and still allow people to clone the basic and advanced crm repos.  But now I am thinking that I should do both.  Maybe make the new version that I have been working on the advanced version as well as setting it up to use as a SaaS.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have no intention of making money off of this but I could see that if it were popular as a SaaS that I would incur the costs of running it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know that either way I have a lot of improvements to make and doing that is a little hard with so many other things occupying my time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does anybody think there would be a need for an easy to use CRM SaaS?</p>
