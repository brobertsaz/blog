<p>Just an update to what is up lately.  I have been busy with work releasing our new <a class="zem_slink" title="Web application" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web-based</a> route optimization application so I have been lacking on new material on the blog.  I have also been messing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django</li>
<li>RefineryCMS (a Ruby on Rails CMS)</li>
<li><a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" rel="homepage" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">RoR</a></li>
<li>a <a class="zem_slink" title="Python (programming language)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> interface for our desktop application</li>
<li>DesertPy.org</li>
</ul>
<p>I will add again that I am somewhat torn between RoR and Django.  The RefineryCMS is simply put...AWESOME!  I need to look at <a class="zem_slink" title="Django-cms" rel="homepage" href="http://django-cms.org">Django - CMS</a> to compare just to be fair.</p>
<p>I was hoping to make it to Cartwheels Python courses but again it seems that money is the deterrent.</p>
<p>I also added a cool <a class="zem_slink" title="QR code" rel="homepage" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1585822/business-card-just-scan-my-qr-code">QR code</a> to the bottom of the right hand section that has my contact info.  I keep seeing these codes for downloading apps to my Android phone and think they are pretty cool.</p>
<p>If you are here for route optimization, I have added my <a class="zem_slink" title="Municipal solid waste" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste">Solid Waste</a> routing paper to the downloads section.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me and stay tuned for new content.</p>
