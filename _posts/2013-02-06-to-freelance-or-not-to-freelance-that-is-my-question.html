<p style="text-align:justify;">Recently I have been seriously questioning my desire to be a Rails freelancer.  I love <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank" rel="homepage">RoR</a> and coding and all that goes with being a freelancer except for the continuos struggle to find new clients.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That struggle has been the core of my recent frustrations and the reason for questioning <a class="zem_slink" title="Freelancer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">freelancing</a>.  For those of you that are considering becoming a freelancer, do not get me wrong, it is a great life and I would never try to deter anybody from becoming a freelance developer.  I think that the one-person freelance operation is great but I tried to take it further.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What are the reasons that people prefer to freelance as opposed to working for the man?  Two main reasons in my opinion; higher pay and not working in an office.  What would make a developer want to work for a company?  In my opinion again, I feel it is for security and benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is what I wanted to offer the guys that work with me; benefits and security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have learned an amazingly lot about running a business mostly the hard way after my first year.  Employees simply will cost more money and by employees I mean W-2 employees.  Contractors cost less for a business.  So I struggled with that; my desire to help out those working with me and the increased cost to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ultimately, I recently failed a couple of those guys.  I just could not find any work for them.  What leads I had were mostly people with great ideas and no money.  Others seemed to prefer the lost cost development available overseas.  I looked on the various freelance sites and boards but all there are there are jobs that pay less than if I went to work in a fast food restaurant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then thought about RoR <a class="zem_slink" title="Telecommuting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">telecommute</a> jobs.  There are not many of those out there.  I guess it is that companies feel that they cannot trust a person to work remotely.  Maybe they hate working in an office and figure that everybody should have to be miserable too.  I know that some big name developers have repeatedly commented on the lack of telecommute jobs.  Hey I might want to work for a Bay Area company but I sure as shit do not want to work there.  I got a headhunter email from Boston asking if I was interested in moving.  Why the hell would I leave my beautiful Phoenix weather to go play in the cold and snow?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I am left with the idea of local jobs.  Punching the time clock (do they still have time clocks anymore) and sitting in an office.  Would I rather do that than be a freelancer? Well, no but the other option is hoping to get new business.  Who know, maybe tomorrow the phone will ring with a great big shiny new application that needs to be built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bottom line, do what makes you happy if you can.  Maybe my feelings are just those of somebody in their 40's and maybe I would fell differently if I were in my 20's.</p>
