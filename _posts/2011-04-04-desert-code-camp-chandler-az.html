<p style="text-align:justify;">What an amazing world we live in today.  I just went to my first Desert Code Camp ( <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com/">http://desertcodecamp.com/</a> ) and it was fantastic!  It is great that there is so much tech going on.  There was such a wide variety of classes that were put on.  I was so impressed with the whole event.  From breakfast to dinner they took care of everything and it didn't cost anything to go to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I got to see a great presentation on <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" rel="homepage" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> 101 put on by <a href="http://www.claytonlz.com/">Clayton Lengel-Zigich</a> that taught me more than all of the tutorials that I have done.  I also sat in on his <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML5" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> class ( all of his presentations are at http://bit.ly/i4lozg ) that was equally informative.  I am not going to rush out and code everything in HTML5 just yet as our friends at Microsoft do NOT have a browser to support it yet (IE5 supports SOME of HTML5) but it is amazing what HTML5 can do.  I just created a form for my companies website using <a class="zem_slink" title="JQuery" rel="homepage" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> so that I can require and validate fields and a lot of this is already in HTML5.  Not to say that jQuery isn't great but why re-build the wheel?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also sat in on a <a class="zem_slink" title="CoffeeScript" rel="homepage" href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> class that was very impressive.  I once looked at javascript and thought it to be too difficult and for that matter a very messy language.  CoffeeScript allows you to write in a clear cut sensible way and then create the .js for you.  Hmm, I may have to look at <a class="zem_slink" title="JavaScript" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> a little more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speaking of JavaScript, I also sat in on a Node.js class which is a is a server-side JavaScript environment.  What was insanely incredible was Nodester ( <a href="http://nodester.com/">http://nodester.com/</a> ) which is a FREE <a class="zem_slink" title="Heroku" rel="homepage" href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> like hosting for Node.js that was created by a friend on mine Chris Matthieu ( @chrismatthieu ).  In addition to this Chris also created a JavaScript based way to place calls within a browser without using a VOIP account or <a class="zem_slink" title="Skype" rel="homepage" href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>.  If you really want to be amazed check out <a href="http://phono.com/">http://phono.com/</a> !!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How much did I love Desert Code Camp?  Enough that I volunteered to help with the next one!</p>
