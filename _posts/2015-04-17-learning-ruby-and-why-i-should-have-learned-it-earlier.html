    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nThe Internet has said it over and over. Did I
    listen? Not right away. The almighty Interwebs have said “LEARN RUBY FIRST!” Nah,
    I do things my way, I do what I want. I should have listened.\r\n\r\nI spent the
    past week and a half sitting down, learning the basics of Ruby, and guess what.
    Rails makes SO MUCH MORE SENSE NOW! So I should have listened to the wise words
    of those who have come before me.\r\n\r\nActually, I think that attempting to
    learn Rails before Ruby helped some. I understood some of the concepts, but then
    after diving deep into Ruby it all started to click.\r\n\r\nThe use of hashes,
    arrays, classes, and all the verbiage that came with Ruby became a snowball in
    my mind. Once the ball began rolling I was able to comprehend even more. I went
    back through some of my projects that I had done originally and just read my code.\r\n\r\nIt
    sounds like a very noob-ish mistake, but I should have learned Ruby right from
    the beginning. I’m a stubborn guy though sometimes, and like I said, I wanted
    to do what I wanted to do. Now, I will say that I am not a Ruby expert per say,
    but I think that I have enough of the basics down that I can go look at <a href=\"http://ruby-doc.org\">Ruby-doc</a>
    and pick my way through them to get what I want.\r\n\r\nMy next project for myself
    will be going through and refactoring my code that is just messy and not clean.
    I also am working on a personal project that I will hopefully debut in the next
    few months.\r\n\r\nShort post, but it’s something I felt I needed to get out.
    Also, thanks to <a href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com\">Treehouse</a> for their great
    resources and helping me learn Ruby!</div>\";}"

<p>I learned Rails from a Rails expert that did not know Ruby very well :(  I learned so much Ruby just from messing around in Rails console. </p>
