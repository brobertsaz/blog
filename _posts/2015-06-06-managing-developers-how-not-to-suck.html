    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nI’ve been a development manager for 15 years.
    I have had the privilege to manage some great people – many of whom have become
    lifelong friends. I’ve also managed people I never want to hear from again. I've
    had some good mentors along the way and I've worked for some great mangers, a
    couple of crummy mangers, and one psychopath. It’s been both a rewarding and challenging
    experience. People who have worked for me tell me I'm a pretty good development
    manger.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I’ve gotten to know many other development mangers.
    I've seen a few really good ones, and many bad ones. I have enjoyed working for
    a world class manger at Microsoft. I’ve also seen a couple of mangers who have
    been fired for how badly they manage people.\r\n\r\nManaging developers is really
    hard. Why? Because software development is fundamentally a creative activity,
    like music, art, architecture, math and writing: Yes, yes yes…. there are strong
    engineering and scientific aspects to software development. Good engineering,
    and sometimes a scientific approach makes good developers better. But at the end
    of the day writing good software is a creative exercise and managing creative
    people is simply hard.\r\n\r\nWe pay developers to do two things: think and be
    creative. Good thinking and being creative cannot be mandated, both must be <em>enabled</em>.
    80% of a development mangers job is enabling people to do their best thinking,
    and be creative, with good continuity over time. Its is impossible to plan, manage
    or schedule thinking and creativity.\r\n\r\nThe other 80% of our collective job
    is shipping stuff.  At some point in time we need to ship our software to the
    people who will use it.  Shipping can be engineered, planned, scheduled and managed.
    The challenge is that enabling people to think and be creative is requires a very
    different skill set than shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be a good development
    manger, then your first task is to simply not suck.  Sucking at some management
    aspect is like a golfer who can’t putt.  A golfer can have a miracle drive, long
    and straight, a great approach game, but if they can’t putt – their drunk buddies
    who <em>can</em> putt will beat them.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://foredecker.wordpress.com/series-managin%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%A6ow-not-to-suck/\"
