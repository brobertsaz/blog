<p style="text-align:justify;">Well, lots have changed recently.  As the title says, new beginnings....</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have had no luck in finding new contracts.  My partner Steve and I are looking at expanding more into the JavaScript market as he worries that Rails is slowly fading away to be replaced by the likes of Node.js and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one language gets popular, everybody rushes to it.  Have to be the cool hipsters with the new stuff on the block.  That is fine.  As more devs move to the new Javascript single page apps there will be more need for Rails developers on legacy applications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, I have for a while been contemplating getting a real job.  I had hoped to work remotely with somebody but that left me with few options.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I got an email 2 weeks ago from my blog from a recruiter.  I know, great yet another recruiter email.  The position sounded interesting and I replied to the recruiter.  Long story short, the recruiter, David Claeys with Tech Recruitment, got me an interview with the company and I started last Wednesday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I just started working at Unitedweb/Nextiva.  I am the first Rails dev there.  All of the other developers are either Java or Python/Django people.  I am working on a legacy Rails app and I am to teach RoR to others there to work on the app with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that I have to say is that Unitedweb/Nextiva is an awesome place to work.  I was so worried about going back to working in an office for the first time in 5 years.  Needless to say, it does not feel like I am working in an office and for that I am grateful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does this mean for Rebel Outpost?  Business as usual.  I will still continue to look for more contract work.  I still want to be able to teach others and be a big part of the local Ruby community.  So as far as I am concerned there is no end in site...</p>
