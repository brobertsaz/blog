    Though I had checked in my code, I had forgotten to back up database and push
    it to the main branch. Well...\r\n\r\nNow you know the value of migrations. I
    am in PHP project. I don't really remember why we choose PHP instead of Rails.
    I think we thought we won't find enough Rails people in Chennai.The result, some
    best practices used by frameworks are lost and mistakes like this occur.\r\n\r\nThe
    more and more I am using PHP, the more and more I appreciate Ruby on Rails. The
    Rails people have thought it well over, possibly they have faced too many difficulties
    while doing a project.\r\n\r\nOf course there are many things I love about Rails
    like migrations and blah blah. Hmmmm lets see, now I am missing it very much.\r\n\r\nRails
    has now become Rolls Royce of web development. There is solution, fast and easy
    way for every thing. If there isn't one, you write a gem, release it and get fame
    for you and your organization.\r\n\r\nA framework is not just a collection of
    code, but its a collection of best practices too. And Rails is doing really good
    at it.</div>\";}"
