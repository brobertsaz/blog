<p style="text-align:justify;">Wow, I am just past 6 months of my blog being up.  I have has a lot more hits than I ever expected to.  I know that the blog started out "Everything <a class="zem_slink" title="Python (programming language)" href="http://www.python.org/" rel="homepage">Python</a>" and then transitioned as I decided to add new topics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Well, guess what, I think I am going to be adding more AGAIN.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My work has me dabbling in <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org/" rel="homepage">Ruby on Rails</a> and from that I am looking at <a class="zem_slink" title="Django (web framework)" href="http://www.djangoproject.com" rel="homepage">Django</a>.  As time goes by I will list my likes and dislikes of both of these <a class="zem_slink" title="Web application framework" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework" rel="wikipedia">web frameworks</a> but not in this article.  I will however at this point say that the Ruby and/or Rails community is a lot more "together" than anything that I can see to get going in Phoenix for Python.  That is disappointing to say the least.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also recently got turned on the <a class="zem_slink" title="JQuery" href="http://jquery.com/" rel="homepage">jQuery</a>.  One word...AWESOME.  I will put my savings calculator (again a hobby turned to work use) in another post but needless to say is that I needed a savings calculator that would have required fields and with a little adaptation, jQuery was the answer.  More so than this is the fact that the calculator can be used on our RoR site as well as our Joomla based website.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So stay tuned for more categories and more topics and thanks for reading....</p>
