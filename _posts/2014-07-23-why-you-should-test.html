    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nTest driven development is both loved and loathed
    by software engineers everywhere. It's a complicated relationship. While the benefits
    of TDD are well established, programmers are human, and the human mind is reluctant
    to associate non visible progress with perceived progress.\r\n \r\nHowever, saying
    \"I'll get this done faster if I don't write tests\" is like saying \"I'll get
    to china faster by going in a straight line.\" It's a great sentiment if you're
    willing to dig through a lot of rock. The fact is that writing tests might seem
    like taking a detour, but they also show you an easier path to where you want
    to go.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Benefits</h2>\r\n\r\nThe first benefit of TDD is something
    almost intangible. Writing tests forces you to think about what you want to do.
    It forces you to plan, to design, and to define in your own mind what needs to
    be done. This is an enormous advantage by itself, but then it goes on and actively
    keeps you on track.\r\n\r\nMost programmers, when faced with a project and left
    to their own devices, will morph the project over time into something almost unrecognizable
    from it's original conception. This isn't necessarily bad, some great ideas have
    been developed by people getting excited and going off on tangents, but it's no
    longer what you set out to accomplish. When you define a test that describes a
    behavior you're committing to following through on that behavior. This keeps simple
    projects simple instead of letting them mutate into something else.\r\n\r\nTDD
    also provides you with a guide. If your tests are designed well enough you should
    always know the next step in a process simply by looking for the next failing
    test to solve.\r\n\r\nFinally, and perhaps least importantly, tests tell you that
    your code is working. Although, to quote <em>Edsger W. Dijkstra</em>, \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"Testing
    shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n</div>\";}"
