<p style="text-align:justify;">Well, I have been a bit busy lately and it seems like I have a thousand things that I want to work on.  If I can only find the energy and the time to do so.....</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is about why Rebelhold totally kicks ass!  A couple of weeks ago I was made partner!!  How is that for advancement opportunity?  Do I miss my old corporate America job?  Fuck NO!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here I am now a co-owner in a company owned and operated by its employees.  I know that I have ranted before about the awesome opportunity that RebelHold has given me.  I had the desire to become a Rails programmer but who hires anybody these days with no college or experience?  McDonalds, that's who.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">RebelHold will soon be a major name in the Rails web development community.  I want RebelHold to be the premium place for Ruby and Rails developers.  We are a collective of developers that encourage people to learn Ruby and Rails and we also believe it is our job to assist in the learning process.  We are building a community of programmers and designers and continuously improving ourselves with in house training and classes.  We have recently made the decision that Fridays are to be set aside for just that purpose.  Who can go to work with us?  Pretty much anybody that has a strong desire to be the best.  You will have to prove yourself to us that you have the desire and willpower to become one of us. We freely support our apprenticeship program and encourage all of those interested.  We are currently expanding our knowledge base to include IOS development as well.  We have members in several states now and are always interested in new talent.  In @m3talsmith's own words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"We believe that through working under such equal conditions, both to us and our clients, and through such revolutionary processes as being honest with each others skill sets, teaching each other, growing in a community that seeks the most quality out of everything that we do, that we will create great software.</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the tools we use to hone this process include frameworks, such as <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, methodologies, like <a class="zem_slink" title="Agile software development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Agile Development</a> and Scrum, elastic data stores, <a class="zem_slink" title="MongoDB" href="http://www.mongodb.org/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> being our favorite, and cloud servers like <a class="zem_slink" title="Heroku" href="http://www.heroku.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. Other steps include lots of travel, a reasonable week of around 30 hours per week, and lots of pair programming; as well as constant experimentation and open source contributions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are also looking for ways to build passive income in order to put us on sound financial footing outside of client work. Some of the passive income ideas include equity in clients, software services, and applications brought to markets such as mobile marketplaces."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why RebelHold kicks ass and why I do not miss the corporate world!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Are you prepared to Rebel?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>We ARE RebelHold.</strong></p>
