<p style="text-align:justify;">I am a Ruby on Rails developer in Phoenix AZ.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I started programming with <a class="zem_slink" title="Python (programming language)" href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Python</a> and Geoprocessing.  I used both for hobby as well as work.  I have used Python for geoprocessing in ArcToolbox in addition to <a class="zem_slink" title="WxPython" href="http://wxpython.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">wxPython</a> for stand-alone <a class="zem_slink" title="Graphical user interface" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">GUI</a>'s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since then, I got into Ruby on Rails for <a class="zem_slink" title="Web application" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">web applications</a>.  I did look into <a class="zem_slink" title="Django (web framework)" href="http://https://djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Django</a> but I found it too difficult to learn.  I continued to learn <a class="zem_slink" title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank" rel="homepage">RoR</a> as a hobby until the opportunity came along for me to leave the big bad corporate world and become a Ruby on Rails developer full time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My blog started as a help for Python and geoprocessing and has since morphed to cover many other topics.  Sometimes my posts are informational and sometimes they are just my opinions.</p>
