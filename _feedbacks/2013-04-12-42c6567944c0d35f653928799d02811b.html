    name is Dyson D' Souza and I work for Packt Publishing, a UK-based publishing
    company specializing in focused IT books. We have recently published a book on
    Programming ArcGIS 10.1 with Python Cookbook, and I was wondering if you'd be
    interested in taking a look at the book and sharing your comments on your blog
    and on Amazon. \r\n\r\nI'm contacting you because I'm aware that you share good
    knowledge in the subject this book covers, and so believe that your comments would
    be important for both consumers and readers alike. I'd be glad to offer you a
    digital copy of the book if you're interested.\r\n\r\nA few details about the
    book: it composes of 304 pages, learn how to create geoprocessing scripts with
    ArcPy, automate map production, printing, and the creation of PDF map books, create
    custom geoprocessing tools that can be shared with others,  customize the ArcGIS
    Desktop interface with Python add-ons, etc. For more information please click
