<p>Hi,<br />
I was wondering if you know if it is possible to programmatically (via python or java) add in a basemap?  The way it is done in arcMap is File-&gt;Add Data-&gt;new basemap but I am trying to create a custom tool to automate some features of map production.  I am using python as well as ArcMap Add-ins using Java. </p>
<p>Thanks for your help.<br />
