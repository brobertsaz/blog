    Bob:\r\n\r\nI am a grad student at Oklahoma State Univ. with no previous python
    and programming experience. For  my research I need to interpolate some of the
    weather variables across the entire state. I have data for multiple weather stations
    and multiple years in a single spreadsheet ( I have uploaded it at go.unl.edu/gha).
    \r\n\r\nI need to write a script to interpolate it on a daily basis or monthly
    basis and also generate general statistics (mean. median, standard deviation)..Would
    you be able to help me? The first thing I need is to generate separate tables
    for separate years..I have spend couple of days trying to find some tutorials
    but no luck so far!\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nKundan\";}"
