    there,\r\n\r\nI came across one of your posts via a page from the Phoenix Ruby
    Group and was curious how often you take interns in. I'm currently a student at
    ASU studying Media Processing with a minor in Computer Science. This semester
    I'm taking a Rails class where I've made a blog, social networking site, plus
    a Q & A app that has helped me get pretty comfortable with Rails; however, I want
    to dive deeper. \r\nBesides RoR, I do a bunch of Arduino hackery, 3D modeling/printing,
    fabrication/prototyping stuff, and more. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n- Alex\";}"
