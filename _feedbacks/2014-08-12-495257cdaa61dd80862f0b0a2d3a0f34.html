    hope you are doing well. \r\n\r\nI came across profile on LinkedIn and I’m looking
    to network with Ruby on Rails professionals as I have a healthcare client looking
    to add an experienced developer. This is a 100% telecommute position with excellent
    compensation. \r\n\r\nThey are seeking a developer with over 5 years of experience
    and who is a strong believer in test driven development.  This is a great opportunity
    to work with a very strong and experienced development group.  Your experience
    looks like it could be a great fit.  \r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and would
    appreciate any referrals of contacts that may be looking for a change at this
    time. I look forward to hearing from you. \r\n\r\n\r\nLuke Brandt\r\nNational
