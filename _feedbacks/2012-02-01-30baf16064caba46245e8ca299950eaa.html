<p>HeyBob!<br />
I just read your blog/discussion on "What's in a Name -programmer or developer?"<br />
Very interesting and I never really thought about it.  When I fill out those forms at trade show or conferences, I always put "programmer/developer" !<br />
Based on your blog (which I totally agree with), here at ADCi, I'm definitely a Developer.  Guess I'm going to start putting "Developer" on those forms instead of "programmer/developer" which now seems to me, redundant!<br />
Hope this are going well for you.<br />
Talk to you later.<br />
