    been following your blog for a couple years and we had an email conversation a
    few years ago when you were working for the garbage truck routing company.\r\n\r\nI
    was wondering if you could provide me with a ball park idea of what that software
    costs.  I work for a company that has an AVL product ( http://eliteextra.com )
    that has been mostly used for the delivery of auto parts, it uses cell phones
    to provide location data.\r\n\r\nWe have steered away from the garbage collection/high
    density type industries because of all the routing requirements involved and it
    just didn't fit our product.\r\n\r\nWe just saw an RFP for a smaller city that
    is looking for something for use in their vehicles that does fit our product--their
    not looking for something to create new routes, just track their vehicles. We
    are considering pursuing this opportunity but are think we would only be competitive
    if our price is lower than the software provided by companies such as your former
    employer. \r\n\r\nSo that is what I'm just curious about. The specific city in
    question has 10 garbage trucks and one dispatcher.\r\n\r\nIf you had any idea
    what the software might cost from a vendor like the one you use to work for, I
    would appreciate any info you could provide.\r\n\r\nAnd, just to be fair, our
    base price starts around $25/month per vehicle.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and sounds
    like you're enjoying your new gig.\r\n\r\nMatt (http://nodedangles.wordpress.com)\";}"
