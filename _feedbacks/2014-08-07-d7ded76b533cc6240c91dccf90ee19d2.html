    Hello Bob Roberts,\r\n\r\nI believe my partner Jay contacted you some months ago
    (Feb or March, I believe) about implementing rails framework on our new website.
    We have a template website in place already and pretty much all we need is a back-end.
    My business partner handle maintenance and development of our website so please
    forgive my ignorance as I'm not as savvy as either of you when it comes to this
    sort of thing. Basically, I'm emailing you today to ask for a quote.\r\n\r\nYou
