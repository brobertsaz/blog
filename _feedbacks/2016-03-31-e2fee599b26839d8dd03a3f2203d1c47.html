<p>Dear Bob</p>
<p>I am relatively new to RoR,<br />
and I am trying to figure out,<br />
how to make browser detection using the 'browser' gem.<br />
I read in one of your threads that you have used it.<br />
Could you please give me some relevant info about installation-usage?<br />
I think documentation of the gem is not very clear.<br />
