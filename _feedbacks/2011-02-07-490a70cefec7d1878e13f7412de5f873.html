    Bob,\r\n\r\nI recently ran across your blog and really like your articles.  I
    am the owner of GeoSpatial Training Services and also the GeoChalkboard Blog (geochalkboard.wordpress.com).
    \ I wanted to touch base with you on a couple things.  First, would you be interested
    in re-publishing some of your articles on our blog?  We could drive a lot of traffic
    to your site as we have about 11,000 subscribers to our weekly email newsletter.
    \ I'm also looking for someone to develop an advanced e-learning course for Python
    and ArcGIS and was wondering if this is something you might be interested in.
    \ We currently have a GIS Programming 101 for ArcGIS: Mastering Python course
    which has been extremely popular.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEric\";}"
