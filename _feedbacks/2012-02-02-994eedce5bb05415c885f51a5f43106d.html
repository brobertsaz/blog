    am a technical recruiter at Wildfire (www.wildfireapp.com); a rapidly growing,
    VC funded tech start up positioned squarely on top of the social media marketing
    revolution.  In collaboration with our VP of Engineering, we have narrowed in
    on the type of candidates we are looking to fill our Ruby developer positions.
    \ We wanted to know if you were in the market or would be open to having a discussion
    with our team about our open roles, our company, and where you could be a fit.
    \ If you are not looking, no pressure.  We were impressed by your profiles and
    contributions and would be interested if you are.\r\n\r\nI have included some
    information on our company and role for you to look at.  Profitable since our
    product launch in Fall 2009, our technology allows companies of all sizes to create
    interactive social media advertising campaigns and publish them across various
    social media platforms.  We are looking for talented, full-stack engineers to
    help evolve the existing app, build new apps from scratch, and take overall architecture
    to the next level.  The core technology stack consists of Ruby on Rails, and we
    are using other technologies such as Sinatra, EventMachine, Cassandra, Redis,
    and Chef.  \r\n\r\nCheck out our team - https://github.com/wildfireapp.\r\n\r\nWe
    are growing our engineering team as there are still many exciting and challenging
    problems we can’t wait to jump into.  We were recently named one of the top 250
    private companies to work for in the world by Always On, and we're a 2X winner
    of the Facebook Fund.  We serve tens of thousands of companies including major
    brands such as Pepsi, Fox, Electronic Arts, the NFL, Toyota and American Express.
